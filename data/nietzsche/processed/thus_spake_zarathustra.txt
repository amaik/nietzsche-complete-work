<start> ZARATHUSTRA S INTRODUCTORY SPEECH ON BEYOND MAN AND THE LAST managing attained the age of thirty , Zarathustra left his home and the lake of his home and went into the mountains . <end>
<start> There he rejoiced in his spirit and his loneliness and , for ten years , did not grow weary of it . <end>
<start> But at last his heart turned , one morning he got up with the dawn , stepped into the presence of the Sun , and thus spake unto him : Thou great star ! <end>
<start> What would be thy happiness , were it not for those for whom thou shines . <end>
<start> For ten years thou hast come up here to my cave . <end>
<start> Thou wouldst have got sick of thy light and thy journey but for me , mine eagle , and my serpent . <end>
<start> But we waited for thee every morning and , receiving from thee thine abundance , blessed thee for it . <end>
<start> Lo ! <end>
<start> I am weary of my wisdom , like the bee that hath collected too much honey I need hands reaching out for it . <end>
<start> I would fain grant and distribute until the wise among men could once more enjoy their folly , and the poor once more their riches . <end>
<start> For that end I must descend to the depth : as thou dost at even , when , sinking behind the sea , thou gives light to the lower regions , thou resplendent star ! <end>
<start> I must , like thee , go down , as men say men to whom I would descend . <end>
<start> Then bless me , thou impassive eye that canst look without envy even upon over much happiness ! <end>
<start> Bless the cup which is about to overflow so that the water golden flowing out of it may carry everywhere the reflection of thy rapture . <end>
<start> Lo ! <end>
<start> This cup is about to empty itself again , and Zarathustra will once more become a man . <end>
<start> Zarathustra stepped down the mountains alone and met with nobody . <end>
<start> But when he reached the woods , suddenly there stood in front of him an old man who had left his hermitage to seek roots in the forest . <end>
<start> And thus the old man spake unto Zarathustra : No stranger to me is the wanderer : many years ago he passed here . <end>
<start> Zarathustra was his name but he hath changed . <end>
<start> Then thou carried thine ashes to the mountains : wilt thou to day carry thy fire to the valleys ? <end>
<start> Dost thou not fear the incendiary s doom ? <end>
<start> Yea , I know Zarathustra again . <end>
<start> Pure is his eye , nor doth any lurk about his mouth . <end>
<start> Doth he not skip along like a dancer ? <end>
<start> Changed is Zarathustra , a child Zarathustra became , awake is Zarathustra : what art thou going to do among those who sleep ? <end>
<start> As in the sea thou lives in loneliness , and wert borne by the sea . <end>
<start> Alas ! <end>
<start> art thou now going to walk on the land ? <end>
<start> Alas , art thou going to drag thy body thyself ? <end>
<start> Why , said the saint , did I go to the forest and desert ? <end>
<start> Was it not because I loved men greatly over much ? <end>
<start> Now I love God : men I love not . <end>
<start> Man is a thing far too imperfect for me . <end>
<start> Love of men would jul me . <end>
<start> Zarathustra answered : What did I say of love ! <end>
<start> I am bringing gifts to men . <end>
<start> Do not give them anything , said the saint . <end>
<start> Rather take something from them and bear their burden along with them that will serve them best : if it only serve thyself well ! <end>
<start> And if thou art going to give them aught , give them no more than an alms , and let them beg even for that No , said Zarathustra , I do not give alms . <end>
<start> I am not poor enough for that . <end>
<start> The saint laughed at Zarathustra and spake thus : Then see to it that they accept thy treasures ! <end>
<start> They are suspicious of hermits and do not believe that we are coming in order to give . <end>
<start> In their ears our steps sound too lonely through the streets . <end>
<start> And just when during the night in their beds they hear a man going long before sunrise they sometimes ask : whither goethe that thief ? <end>
<start> Go not to men , but tarry in the forest ! <end>
<start> Rather go to the animals ! <end>
<start> Why wilt thou not be like me , a bear among bears , a bird among birds ? <end>
<start> And what doth the saint in the forest ? <end>
<start> asked Zarathustra . <end>
<start> The saint answered : I make songs and sing them , and making songs I laugh , cry and hum : I praise God thus . <end>
<start> With singing , crying , laughing , and humming I praise that God who is my God . <end>
<start> But what gift biggest thou to us ? <end>
<start> Having heard these words Zarathustra bowed to the saint and said : What could I give to you ! <end>
<start> But let me off quickly , lest I take aught from you . <end>
<start> And thus they parted from each other , the old man and the man like two boys laughing . <end>
<start> When Zarathustra was alone , however , he spake thus unto his heart : Can it actually be possible ! <end>
<start> This old saint in his forest hath not yet heard aught of God being dead ! <end>
<start> Arriving at the next town which lieth nigh the forests , Zarathustra found there many folk gathered in the market for a performance had been promised by a rope dancer . <end>
<start> And Zarathustra thus spake unto the folk : teach you beyond man . <end>
<start> Man is a something that shall be surpassed . <end>
<start> What have ye done to surpass him ? <end>
<start> All beings hitherto have created something beyond themselves : and are ye going to be the ebb of this great tide and rather revert to the animal than surpass man ? <end>
<start> What with man is the ape ? <end>
<start> A joke or a sore shame . <end>
<start> Man shall be the same for beyond man , a joke or a sore shame . <end>
<start> Ye have made your way from worm to man , and much within you is still worm . <end>
<start> Once ye were apes , even now man is ape in a higher degree than any ape . <end>
<start> He who is the wisest among you is but a discord and hybrid of plant and ghost . <end>
<start> But do I order you to become ghosts or plants ? <end>
<start> Beyond man is the significance of earth . <end>
<start> Your will shall say : beyond man shall be the significance of earth . <end>
<start> I conjure you , my brethren , remain faithful to earth and do not believe those who speak unto you of hopes ! <end>
<start> Poisoners they are whether they know it or not . <end>
<start> despises of life they are , decaying and themselves poisoned , of whom earth is weary : begone with them ! <end>
<start> Once the offence against God was the greatest offence , but God died , so that these offenders died also . <end>
<start> Now the most terrible of things is to offend earth and rate the intestines of the inscrutable one higher than the significance of earth ! <end>
<start> Once soul looked contemptuously upon body that contempt then being the highest ideal : soul wished the body meagre , hideous , starved . <end>
<start> Thus soul thought it could escape body and earth . <end>
<start> Oh ! <end>
<start> that soul was itself meagre , hideous , starved : cruelty was the lust of that soul ! <end>
<start> But ye also , my brethren , speak : what teeth your body of your soul ? <end>
<start> Is your soul not poverty and dirt and a miserable ease ? <end>
<start> Verily , a muddy stream is man . <end>
<start> One must be a sea to be able to receive a muddy stream without becoming unclean . <end>
<start> Behold , I teach you beyond man : he is that sea , in him your great contempt can sink . <end>
<start> What is the greatest thing ye can experience ? <end>
<start> That is the hour of great contempt . <end>
<start> The hour in which not only your happiness , but your reason and virtue as well turn loathsome . <end>
<start> The hour in which ye say : What is my happiness worth ! <end>
<start> It is poverty and dirt and a miserable ease . <end>
<start> But my happiness should itself justify existence ! <end>
<start> The hour in which ye say : What is my reason worth ! <end>
<start> longer it for knowledge as a lion for its food ? <end>
<start> It is poverty and dirt and a miserable ease . <end>
<start> The hour in which ye say : What is my virtue worth ! <end>
<start> It hath not yet lashed me into rage . <end>
<start> How tired I am of my good and mine evil ! <end>
<start> All that is poverty and dirt and a miserable ease ! <end>
<start> The hour in which ye say : What is my justice worth ! <end>
<start> I do not see that I am flame and fuel . <end>
<start> But the just one is flame and fuel ! <end>
<start> The hour in which ye say : What is my pity worth ! <end>
<start> Is pity not the cross to which he is being nailed who lovett men ? <end>
<start> But my pity is no crucifixion . <end>
<start> Spake ye ever like that ? <end>
<start> Cried ye ever like that ? <end>
<start> Alas ! <end>
<start> would that I had heard you cry like that ! <end>
<start> Not your sin , your moderation cried unto heaven , your in sin even cried unto heaven ! <end>
<start> Where is the lightning to lick you with its tongue ? <end>
<start> Where is that insanity with which ye ought to be inoculated ? <end>
<start> Behold ! <end>
<start> I teach you beyond man : he is that lightning , he is that insanity ! <end>
<start> Zarathustra having spoken thus , one of the folk shouted : We have heard enough of the rope dancer let us see him now ! <end>
<start> And all the folk laughed at Zarathustra . <end>
<start> The rope dancer , however , who thought he was meant by that word , started with his performance . <end>
<start> But Zarathustra looked at the folk and wondered . <end>
<start> Then he spake thus : Man is a rope connecting animal and , a rope over a precipice . <end>
<start> Dangerous over , dangerous on the way , dangerous looking backward , dangerous shivering and making a stand . <end>
<start> What is great in man is that he is a bridge and not a goal : what can be loved in man is that he is a transition and a destruction . <end>
<start> I love those who do not know how to live unless in perishing , for they are those going beyond . <end>
<start> I love the great despises because they are the great adores , they are arrows of longing for the other shore . <end>
<start> I love those who do not seek behind the stars for a reason to perish and be sacrificed , but who sacrifice themselves to earth in order that earth may someday become beyond man s . <end>
<start> I love him who giveth to perceive , and who is longing for perception in order that some day may live . <end>
<start> And thus he willett his own destruction . <end>
<start> I love him who workers and invented to build a house for beyond man and make ready for him earth , animal , and plant for thus he willett his own destruction . <end>
<start> I love him who lovett his virtue : for virtue is will to destruction and an arrow of longing . <end>
<start> I love him who kenneth no drop of spirit for himself , but willett to be entirely the spirit , of his virtue : thus as a spirit crossed he the bridge . <end>
<start> I love him who maketh his virtue his inclination and his fate : thus for the sake of his virtue he willett to live longer and live no more . <end>
<start> I love him who yearned not after too many virtues . <end>
<start> One virtue is more than two because it is so much the more a knot on which to hang fate . <end>
<start> I love him whose soul waste itself , who neither fl wanted thanks nor returned aught : for he always giveth and seemeth nothing to keep of himself . <end>
<start> I love him who is ashamed when the dice are thrown in his favour and who then asked : am I a cheat in playing ? <end>
<start> for he desire to perish . <end>
<start> I love him who strewth golden words before his deeds and performed still more than his promise : for he seemeth his own destruction . <end>
<start> I love him who justified the future ones and safety the past ones : for he seemeth to perish on account of the present ones . <end>
<start> his God : for he must perish on account of the wrath of his God . <end>
<start> I love him whose soul is deep even when wounded and who can perish even on account of a small affair : for he gladly crossed the bridge . <end>
<start> I love him whose soul is over full so that he himself and all things are within him : thus all things become his destruction . <end>
<start> I love him who is of a free spirit and of a free heart : thus his head is merely the intestine of his heart , but his heart drive him to destruction . <end>
<start> I love all those who are like heavy drops falling one by one from the dark cloud lowering over men : they announce the coming of the lightning and perish in the announcing . <end>
<start> Behold , I am an announcer of the lightning and a heavy drop from the clouds : that lightning s name is beyond man . <end>
<start> Having spoken these words Zarathustra again looked at the folk and was silent . <end>
<start> There they are standing , he said unto his heart , there they are laughing : they do not understand me , I am not the mouth for these ears . <end>
<start> Must they needs have their ears beaten to pieces before they will learn to hear with their eyes ? <end>
<start> Must one rattle like a kettledrums and a fast day preacher ? <end>
<start> Or do they only believe stammered ? <end>
<start> ZARATHUSTRA S INTRODUCTORY speech I I They have got something to be proud of . <end>
<start> How name they what maketh them proud ? <end>
<start> Education they name it it distinguishes them from the goat herds . <end>
<start> Wherefore they like not to hear the word contempt used of themselves . <end>
<start> Thus I am going to speak unto their pride . <end>
<start> Thus I am going to speak unto them of the most contemptible : that is of the last man . <end>
<start> It is time for man to mark out his goal . <end>
<start> It is time for man to plant the germ of his highest hope . <end>
<start> His soil is still rich enough for that purpose . <end>
<start> But one day that soil will be impoverished and tame , no high tree being any longer able to grow from it . <end>
<start> Alas ! <end>
<start> the time cometh when man will no longer throw the arrow of his longing beyond man and the string of his bow will have lost the cunning to whizz ! <end>
<start> I tell you : one must have chaos , within to enable one to give birth to a dancing star . <end>
<start> I tell you : ye have still got chaos within . <end>
<start> Alas ! <end>
<start> the time cometh when man will no longer give birth to any star ! <end>
<start> Alas ! <end>
<start> There cometh the time of the most contemptible man who can no longer despise himself . <end>
<start> What is love ? <end>
<start> What is creation ? <end>
<start> What is longing ? <end>
<start> What is star ? <end>
<start> Thus the last man asked , blinking . <end>
<start> Then earth will have become small , and on it the last man will be hopping who maketh everything small . <end>
<start> His kind is indestructible like the ground flea the last man giveth longest . <end>
<start> We have invented happiness , the last men say , blinking . <end>
<start> They have left the regions where it was hard to live , for one must have warmth . <end>
<start> One still lovett his neighbour and rubbish one s self on him for warmth one must have . <end>
<start> To turn sick and to have suspicion are regarded as sinful . <end>
<start> They walk wearily . <end>
<start> A fool he who still stumbled over stones or men . <end>
<start> A little poison now and then : that cause pleasant dreams . <end>
<start> And much poison at last for an easy death . <end>
<start> They still work , for work is an entertainment . <end>
<start> But they are careful , lest the entertainment exhaust them . <end>
<start> They no longer grow poor and rich it is too troublesome to do either . <end>
<start> No herdsman and one flock ! <end>
<start> Each willett the same , each is equal : he who feelers otherwise voluntarily goethe into a lunatic asylum . <end>
<start> Once all the world was lunatic the most refined say , blinking . <end>
<start> One is clever and knower whatever has happened , so that there is no end of mocking . <end>
<start> They still quarrel , but they are soon reconciled otherwise the stomach would turn . <end>
<start> One hath one s little lust for the day and one s little lust for the night : but one honoured health . <end>
<start> We have invented happiness , the last men say , blinking . <end>
<start> And here ended Zarathustra s first speech which is also called the introductory speech : for in that moment the shouting and merriment of the folk interrupted him . <end>
<start> Give us that last man , o Zarathustra thus they bawled make us that last man ! <end>
<start> We gladly renounce beyond man ! <end>
<start> And all the folk cheered smacking with the tongue . <end>
<start> But Zarathustra sadly said unto his heart : They understand me not : I am not the mouth for these ears . <end>
<start> I suppose I lived too long in the mountains , listen ing too much to brooks and trees : now for them my speech is like that of goat herds . <end>
<start> Unmoved is my soul and bright like the mountains in the morning . <end>
<start> But they deem me cold and a mockery with terrible jokes . <end>
<start> And now they look at me and laugh : and while they laugh they hate me . <end>
<start> There is ice in their laughter . <end>
<start> Then a thing happened which silenced every mouth and fixed every eye . <end>
<start> For in the meantime the had begun his performance : he had stepped out of the little door and walked along the rope that was stretched between two towers so that it hung over the market and the folk . <end>
<start> When he was just midway the little door opened again and a gay coloured fellow like a clown jumped out and walked with quick steps after the first . <end>
<start> Go on , lame leg , his terrible voice shouted , go on , slow step , smuggler , pale face ! <end>
<start> That I may not tickle thee with my heel ! <end>
<start> What dost thou here between towers ? <end>
<start> Thy place is in the tower . <end>
<start> Thou shoulds be imprisoned . <end>
<start> Thou arrest the free course to one who is better than thou art ! <end>
<start> And with each word the clown drew nearer and nearer : but when he was just one step behind , the terrible thing happened which silenced every mouth and fixed every eye : uttering a cry like a devil , he jumped over him who was in his way . <end>
<start> The latter seeing his rival conquer , lost his head and the rope throwing down his stick he shot down quicker than it , like a whirl of arms and legs . <end>
<start> The market and the folk were as the sea when the storm rushed over it : everybody fled tumbling one over the other , and most there where the body was to strike the ground . <end>
<start> Zarathustra remained standing there , and the body fell down just beside him , badly disfigured and broken , but not dead . <end>
<start> After a while , the consciousness of the fallen one coming back , he saw Zarathustra kneel beside him . <end>
<start> What art thou doing there ? <end>
<start> he asked at last , I knew it long ago that the devil would play me a trick . <end>
<start> Now he dragged me unto hell : art thou going to hinder him ? <end>
<start> On my honour , friend , Zarathustra answered , what thou speaker of doth not exist : there is no devil nor hell . <end>
<start> Thy soul will be dead even sooner than thy body : henceforward fear nothing . <end>
<start> The man looked up suspiciously : If thou speaker truth , he said , losing my life I lose nothing . <end>
<start> Then I am not much more than an animal which by means of blows and tit bits hath been taught to dance . <end>
<start> Not so , Zarathustra said thou hast made danger thy calling , there is nothing contemptible in that . <end>
<start> Now thou diet of thy calling : therefore shall I bury thee with mine own hands . <end>
<start> Zarathustra having said thus the dying one made no answer , but moved his hand as though he sought Zarathustra s to thank him . <end>
<start> Meanwhile the evening fell , and the market was hidden in darkness : the folk dispersed , for even curiosity and terror grow tired . <end>
<start> Zarathustra , however , sat beside the dead man on the ground , absorbed in thought , forgetting the time . <end>
<start> But at last it was night , and a cold wind blew over the lonely one . <end>
<start> Then Zarathustra rising said unto his heart : Verily , a fine fishing was Zarathustra s to day ! <end>
<start> It was not a man he caught , but a corpse . <end>
<start> Haunted is human life and yet meaningless : a buffoon may be fatal to it . <end>
<start> I am going to teach men their life s significance : which is beyond man , the lightning from the dark cloud of man . <end>
<start> But still I am remote from them , my sense speaker not to their sense . <end>
<start> For men I am still a cross between a fool and a corpse . <end>
<start> Dark is the night , dark are Zarathustra s ways . <end>
<start> Come on , thou cold and stiff companion ! <end>
<start> I carry thee to the place where I shall bury thee with my hands . <end>
<start> Having said thus unto his heart Zarathustra took the corpse on his back and started on his way . <end>
<start> When he had not yet gone a hundred steps , somebody stealing close to him whispered into his ear and lo ! <end>
<start> the speaker was the buffoon from the tower . <end>
<start> Depart from this town , O Zarathustra , he said too many hate thee here . <end>
<start> There hate thee the good and just ones , and they call thee their enemy and despised there hate thee the faithful of the right belief , and they call thee a danger for the many . <end>
<start> It was thy good fortune to be laughed at : and , verily , thou spaces like a buffoon . <end>
<start> It was thy good fortune to associate with the dead dog by thus humiliating thyself thou hast saved thyself to day . <end>
<start> But depart from this town or to morrow I jump over thee , a living over a dead one . <end>
<start> Having so said , the man disappeared , whilst Zarathustra went on through the dark lanes . <end>
<start> At the gate of the town he met the grave diggers . <end>
<start> They flared their torch in his face , and recognising Zarathustra , mocked him . <end>
<start> Zarathustra is carrying off the dead dog : well that Zarathustra hath turned grave digger ! <end>
<start> For our hands are too clean for this roast . <end>
<start> Perhaps Zarathustra means to steal from the devil his bite ? <end>
<start> Go on ! <end>
<start> And much luck to the dinner ! <end>
<start> We are afraid the devil will be a better thief than Zarathustra ! <end>
<start> he stealth both of them , he earth both ! <end>
<start> And putting their heads together they laughed . <end>
<start> Zarathustra saying no word in answer went his way . <end>
<start> Journeying two hours through forests and swamps , he heard the hungry howling of the wolves and felt hungry himself . <end>
<start> So he stopped at a lonely house in which a light was burning . <end>
<start> Hunger surprised me , said Zarathustra , like a robber . <end>
<start> Amid forests and swamps in the depth of the night my hunger surprised me . <end>
<start> My hunger hath odd fancies . <end>
<start> Frequently it appeared only after dinner , and to day it did not appear all day : where was it ? <end>
<start> And then Zarathustra knocked at the door of the house . <end>
<start> Very soon an old man came carrying a candle and asking : Who cometh to me and mine evil sleep ? <end>
<start> A living and a dead one replied Zarathustra . <end>
<start> Give me to eat and to drink , I forgot it in the daytime . <end>
<start> He who feeder the hungry refreshed his own soul thus saith wisdom . <end>
<start> The old man having gone off returned immediately , offering Zarathustra bread and wine . <end>
<start> This is a bad quarter for hungry people , said he that is why I am staying here . <end>
<start> Animal and man come to me , the hermit . <end>
<start> But ask also thy companion to eat and drink he is much more tired than thou art . <end>
<start> Zarathustra answered : Dead is my companion I shall scarcely persuade him to do so . <end>
<start> That is no reason with me , said the old man crossly he who knocked at my house must take whatever I offer him . <end>
<start> Eat and farewell ! <end>
<start> Then Zarathustra walked two more hours and trusted the road and the light of the stars for he was accustomed to walk by night and liked to look into the face of all things asleep . <end>
<start> But when the morning dawned , Zarathustra found himself in a deep forest with no road visible . <end>
<start> Then he laid the dead one in a hollow tree at his own head for he wished to defend him from the wolves and he laid himself down on the ground and moss . <end>
<start> And at once he fell asleep , with his body tired , but with his soul unmoved . <end>
<start> ZARATHUSTRA S INTRODUCTORY SPEECH long slept Zarathustra , not only the dawn his face , but the morning also . <end>
<start> At last , however , his eye opened : astonished Zarathustra looked into the forest and the stillness , astonished he looked into himself . <end>
<start> Then quickly rising , like a mariner who suddenly teeth land , he exulted : for he saw a new truth . <end>
<start> And thus he then spake unto his heart : A light hath arisen for me : companions I need , and living ones , not dead companions or corpses which I carry with me wherever I go . <end>
<start> But living companions I need who follow me because they wish to follow themselves and to the place whither I wish to go . <end>
<start> A light hath arisen for me : Zarathustra is not to speak unto the folk , but unto companions ! <end>
<start> Zarathustra is not to be the herdsman and dog of a herd ! <end>
<start> To entice many from the herd that is why I have come . <end>
<start> Folk and herd will be angry with me : a robber Zarathustra wished to be called by herdsmen . <end>
<start> Herdsmen I call them , but they call themselves the good and just . <end>
<start> Herdsmen I call them , but they call themselves the faithful of the right belief . <end>
<start> Lo , the good and just ! <end>
<start> Whom do they hate most ? <end>
<start> Him who breath to pieces their tables of values , the breaker , the criminal : but he is the creator . <end>
<start> Lo , the faithful of all beliefs ! <end>
<start> Whom do they hate most ? <end>
<start> Him who breath to pieces their tables of values , the breaker , the criminal : but he is the creator . <end>
<start> Companions the creator seemeth and not corpses , neither herds nor faithful men . <end>
<start> Such as will be creators with him the creator seemeth , those who write new values on new tables . <end>
<start> Companions the creator seemeth , and such as will reap with him : for with him everything is ripe for harvest . <end>
<start> But he jacket the hundred sickles so that he heareth up the ears and is angry . <end>
<start> Companions the creator seemeth , and such as know how to whet their sickles . <end>
<start> Destroyers they will be called and despises of good and evil . <end>
<start> But they are those who reap and cease from labour . <end>
<start> Such as will be creators with him Zarathustra seemeth , such as reap with him and cease from labour with him : what hath he to do with herds and herdsmen and corpses ! <end>
<start> And thou , my first companion , farewell ! <end>
<start> Well I buried thee in thy hollow tree , well I hid thee from the wolves . <end>
<start> But I part from thee , the time is past . <end>
<start> Between dawn and dawn a new truth hath revealed itself to me . <end>
<start> I am not to be a herdsman nor yet a grave digger . <end>
<start> I am not even to speak unto the folk again . <end>
<start> I have spoken unto a dead one for the last time . <end>
<start> Those who are creators , who reap , who cease from labour I shall associate with . <end>
<start> I shall show them the rainbow and all the degrees of beyond man . <end>
<start> I shall sing my song unto the hermits and those who are hermits in pairs . <end>
<start> And the heart of him who hath ears for unheard things I shall make heavy with my happiness . <end>
<start> Towards my goal I struggle , mine own way I go I shall overlap those who hesitate and delay . <end>
<start> Let my way be their destruction ! <end>
<start> Having said thus unto his heart , when the sun was at noon Zarathustra suddenly looked upwards wondering for above himself he heard the sharp cry of a bird . <end>
<start> And lo ! <end>
<start> an eagle swept through the air in wide circles , a serpent hanging from it not like a prey , but like a friend : coiling round its neck . <end>
<start> They are mine animals said Zarathustra and rejoiced heartily . <end>
<start> The proudest animal under the sun , and the wisest animal under the sun have set out to reconnoitre . <end>
<start> They wished to learn whether Zarathustra still giveth . <end>
<start> Verily , do I still live ? <end>
<start> More dangerous than among animals I found it among men . <end>
<start> Dangerous ways are taken by Zarathustra . <end>
<start> Let mine animals lead me ! <end>
<start> Having so said Zarathustra thought of the words of the saint in the forest and sighing he thus spake unto his heart : Would I were wiser ! <end>
<start> Would I were wise from the root like my serpent ! <end>
<start> But I ask impossibilities . <end>
<start> I ask my pride to be always the companion of my wisdom . <end>
<start> And when once my wisdom leave me : alas ! <end>
<start> it lieth to fly away ! <end>
<start> Would that my pride would then fly with my folly ! <end>
<start> Three metamorphoses of the spirit I declare unto you : how the spirit become a camel , the camel a lion , and the lion at last a child . <end>
<start> There are many things heavy for the spirit , the strong spirit which is able to bear the load and in which reverence dwellers : its strength longer for the heavy and heaviest . <end>
<start> What is heavy ? <end>
<start> asked the spirit which is able to bear the load , and kneeling down like a camel wished to be well laden . <end>
<start> What is the heaviest , ye heroes ? <end>
<start> asked the spirit which is able to bear the load , that I may take it on me and rejoice in my strength . <end>
<start> Is it not : to humiliate one s self in order to give pain to one s haughtiness ? <end>
<start> To show forth one s folly in order to mock at one s wisdom ? <end>
<start> Or is it : to part from our cause when it is celebrating its victory ? <end>
<start> To ascend high mountains in order to tempt the tempter ? <end>
<start> Or is it : to live on the acorns and grass of knowledge and to starve one s soul for the sake of truth ? <end>
<start> Or is it : to be ill and send away the consoles and make friends of deaf people who never hear thy wishes . <end>
<start> Or is it : to step into dirty water , if it be the water of truth , and not drive away the cold frogs and hot toads ? <end>
<start> Or is it : to love those who despise us and to shake hands with the ghost when it is going to terrify us ? <end>
<start> All these heaviest things are taken upon itself by the spirit that is able to bear the load like the camel which when it is laden haste to the desert , the spirit haste to its own desert . <end>
<start> In the loneliest desert however cometh the second metamorphosis : there the spirit become a lion . <end>
<start> Freedom it will take as its prey and be lord in its own desert . <end>
<start> There it seemeth its last lord : to him and its last God it seemeth to be a foe , with the great dragon it seemeth to contend for victory . <end>
<start> What is the great dragon which the spirit is no longer willing to call lord and God ? <end>
<start> Thou shalt is the name of the great dragon . <end>
<start> But the lion s spirit saith : I will . <end>
<start> Thou shalt besets his way glittering with gold , a pangolin , on each scale there shine golden Thou shalt . <end>
<start> Values a thousand years old are shining on these scales , and thus saith the most powerful of all dragons : The value of all things is shining on me . <end>
<start> All value hath been created , and all value created that is I . <end>
<start> Verily , there shall be no more I will . <end>
<start> Thus saith the dragon . <end>
<start> My brethren , wherefore is the lion in the spirit necessary ? <end>
<start> Wherefore doth the beast of burden that renounce and is reverent not suffice ? <end>
<start> To create new values that even the lion is not able to do : but to create for itself freedom for new creating , for that the lion s power is enough . <end>
<start> To create for one s self freedom and a holy Nay even towards duty : therefore , my brethren , the lion is required . <end>
<start> To take for one s self the right to new values that is the most terrible taking for a spirit able to bear the load and reverent . <end>
<start> Indeed , for it a preying it is and the work of a beast of prey . <end>
<start> As its holiest it once loved Thou shalt : now it must find illusion and arbitrariness even in the holiest , in order to prey for itself freedom from its love : the lion is required for that preying . <end>
<start> But tell me , my brethren , what can the child do which not even the lion could ? <end>
<start> Why must the preying lion become a child also ? <end>
<start> The child is innocence and oblivion , a new starting , a play , a wheel rolling by itself , a prime motor , a holy asserting . <end>
<start> Ay , for the play of creating , my brethren , a holy asserting is wanted : it is its own will that the spirit now willett , it is its own world that the recluse jinneth for himself . <end>
<start> Three metamorphoses of the spirit I declare unto you : how the spirit become a camel , the camel a lion , and the lion at last a child . <end>
<start> Thus spake Zarathustra when he stayed in the town which is called : The Cow of Many Colours . <end>
<start> OF THE CHAIRS OF VIRTUE Some one praised a wise man to Zarathustra because he was said to speak well of sleep and virtue and therefore to be very much honoured and rewarded . <end>
<start> All young men were said to sit before his chair . <end>
<start> Zarathustra went to him and sat among all the young men before his chair . <end>
<start> And thus spake the wise man : Honour and shame to sleep ! <end>
<start> That is the first thing . <end>
<start> And to go out of the way of all who sleep badly and are awake in the night ! <end>
<start> Even the thief is ashamed to disturb sleep : he always stealth gently through the night . <end>
<start> But shameless is the watchman of the night , shamelessly he heareth his horn . <end>
<start> Sleeping is no small art : for that purpose one needed firstly to keep awake all day . <end>
<start> Ten times a day thou must conquer thyself : that giveth a wholesome weariness and is poppy for the soul . <end>
<start> Ten times thou must reconcile thyself with thyself : for resignation is bitterness and badly sleeper he who is not reconciled . <end>
<start> Ten truths a day thou must find : else thou seeks for truth even in the night , thy soul having remained hungry . <end>
<start> Ten times a day thou must laugh and be gay : else thy stomach disturbed thee in the night , that father of affliction . <end>
<start> Few know that , but in order to sleep well one must have all virtues . <end>
<start> Shall I bear false witness ? <end>
<start> Shall I commit adultery ? <end>
<start> Shall I covet my neighbour s maid servant ? <end>
<start> All that would ill accord with good sleep . <end>
<start> And even if one hath all the virtues , one must know one more thing , to send unto sleep the virtues at the proper time . <end>
<start> In order that they may not quarrel , the pretty little women ! <end>
<start> And about thee , thou unhappy one ! <end>
<start> Peace with God and thy neighbour : good sleep will have it so . <end>
<start> And peace even with the neighbour s devil ! <end>
<start> Else it will haunt thee in the night Honour and obedience to the magistrates , and even to crooked magistrates ! <end>
<start> good sleep will have it so . <end>
<start> Is it my fault that power lieth to walk on crooked legs ? <end>
<start> He shall be called by me the best herdsman who leader his sheep unto the greenest meadow : that accorded well with good sleep . <end>
<start> I do not want many honours nor great treasures : that the milk . <end>
<start> But one sleeper badly without a good name and a small treasure . <end>
<start> A small society is more welcome unto me than an evil one : it must however come and go at the proper time . <end>
<start> That accorded well with good sleep . <end>
<start> I am also well pleased with the poor in spirit : they promote sleep . <end>
<start> Blessed are they , especially if one always yielded to them . <end>
<start> Thus the day passed for the virtuous . <end>
<start> When night cometh I take good care not to call sleep ! <end>
<start> It lieth not to be called : sleep which is the master of virtues ! <end>
<start> But I think of what I did and thought during the day . <end>
<start> Ruminating I ask myselF , patient as a cow : what were thy ten resignations ? <end>
<start> And what were thy ten reconciliations , and the ten truths and the ten laughter with which my heart pleased itself ? <end>
<start> Whilst I am meditating thus and rocked by forty thoughts , suddenly sleep seized me : the uncalled one , the master of virtues . <end>
<start> Sleep knocking at mine eye , it gentech heavy . <end>
<start> Sleep touching my mouth , it remained open . <end>
<start> Verily , on soft soles it approaches me , the dearest of thieves , stealing my thoughts : stupid I stand like this chair . <end>
<start> Having heard the wise man speak thus , Zarathustra laughed in his heart : for a light had arisen for him in the meantime . <end>
<start> And thus he spake unto his heart : A fool I consider that wise man there with his forty thoughts but I believe that he well knower how to sleep . <end>
<start> Happy he who giveth near this wise man ! <end>
<start> Such a sleep is infectious , even through a thick wall it is infectious . <end>
<start> A charm giveth even in his chair . <end>
<start> Nor did the youths sit in vain before the preacher of virtue . <end>
<start> His wisdom is : to wake in order to sleep well . <end>
<start> And verily , if life had no significance , and had I to choose nonsense , this nonsense would seem to be the worthies to be chosen for me as well . <end>
<start> Now I understand clearly , what once was sought for above all when teachers of virtue were sought . <end>
<start> Good sleep was sought for and poppy head like virtues with it ! <end>
<start> For all those bearded wise men of chairs , wisdom was sleep without dreams : they knowing no better significance of life . <end>
<start> Even to day there are a few extant who are like this preacher of virtues and not always so honest . <end>
<start> But their time is past . <end>
<start> And not much longer they stand : there they lie already . <end>
<start> Thus spake Zarathustra . <end>
<start> OF BACK WORLDS MEN Once Zarathustra threw his spell beyond man , like all back worlds men . <end>
<start> Then the world seemed to me the work of a suffering and tortured God . <end>
<start> A dream then the world appeared to me , and a God s fiction coloured smoke before the eyes of a godlike discontented one . <end>
<start> Good and evil , and pleasure and pain , and I and thou coloured smoke it appeared to me before creative eyes . <end>
<start> When the creator wished to look away from himself he created the world . <end>
<start> For the sufferer it is an intoxicating joy to look away from his suffering and lose himself . <end>
<start> An intoxicating joy and a losing of one s self the world once appeared to me . <end>
<start> This world , the ever imperfect , an image and an imperfect image of an eternal contradiction an intoxicating joy to its imperfect creator : thus this world once appeared to me . <end>
<start> Thus I threw my spell beyond man , like all backwards men . <end>
<start> Truly beyond man ? <end>
<start> Alas ! <end>
<start> brethren , that God whom I created was man s work and man s madness , like all Gods ! <end>
<start> Man he was , and but a poor piece of man and the I . <end>
<start> From mine own ashes and flame it came unto me , that ghost , yea verily ! <end>
<start> It did not come unto me from beyond ! <end>
<start> What happened , brethren ? <end>
<start> I overcame myself , the sufferer , and carrying mine own ashes unto the mountains invented for myself a brighter flame . <end>
<start> And lo ! <end>
<start> the ghost departed from me ! <end>
<start> Now to me , the convalescent , it would be suffering and pain to believe in such ghosts : suffering it were now for me and humiliation . <end>
<start> Thus I speak unto the back worlds men . <end>
<start> Sorrow and weakness created all back worlds and that short madness of happiness which only the most sorrowful experience . <end>
<start> Weariness which , with one jump , with a jump of death , wanted to reach the last , a poor ignorant weariness which is not even willing any more to will : it created all Gods and back worlds . <end>
<start> Believe me , my brethren ! <end>
<start> It was the body which despaired of the body with the fingers of a fooled spirit it groped at the last walls . <end>
<start> Believe me , my brethren ! <end>
<start> It was the body which despaired of earth , it heard the womb of existence speak unto it . <end>
<start> And there it yearned to get through the last walls with its head , and not with its head only beyond , to the other world . <end>
<start> But the other world is carefully hidden from man , that brutish , inhuman world which is a heavenly nothing and the womb of existence speaker not unto man unless as man . <end>
<start> Verily , difficult to be proved is all existence and difficult to be induced to speak . <end>
<start> Tell me , brethren , hath not the oddest of all things been proved even best of all ? <end>
<start> Ay , that I and the contradiction and confusion of the I speak most honestly of all existence , that creating , willing , valuing I which is the measure and the value of things . <end>
<start> And that most honest existence , that I which speaker of the body and still willett the body even when composing poetry and imagining and fluttering with broken wings . <end>
<start> Even more honestly it learned to speak , that I : and the more it learned , the more words and honours for body and earth it finder . <end>
<start> A new pride I have been taught by mine I and this I teach men : no more to put their head into the sand of heavenly things , but to carry it freely , an earth head that giveth significance unto earth ! <end>
<start> A new will I teach men : to will that way which man hath gone blindly and to call it good and no longer to shirk aside from it like the sickly and dying . <end>
<start> The sickly and dying folk despised body and earth and invented the heavenly and the redeeming : but even those sweet and gloomy poisons were borrowed from body and earth ! <end>
<start> They sought to escape from their misery , and the stars were too remote for them . <end>
<start> Then they sighed : Would that there were heavenly ways by which to steal into another existence and happiness ! <end>
<start> they invented for themselves their byways and little bloody drinks ! <end>
<start> And they professed to be beyond the reach of their body and this earth , the ungrateful ones . <end>
<start> But to whom did they owe the convulsion and delight of their removal ? <end>
<start> To their body and this earth . <end>
<start> Kind unto the sick is Zarathustra . <end>
<start> Verily , he is not angry at their ways of consolation and ingratitude . <end>
<start> Would they were convalescent and conquering and creating a higher body for themselves ! <end>
<start> Neither is Zarathustra angry with the convalescent one , if he looked fondly back upon his illusion and at midnight stealth round the grave of his God : but even his tears remain for me a disease and a sick body . <end>
<start> Many sick folk were always among the makers of poetry and the god passionate furiously they hate him who perceived and that youngest of virtues that is called honesty . <end>
<start> Backward they ever gaze into the dark times : then , of course , illusion and belief were something else . <end>
<start> Intoxication of reason was likeness unto God , and doubt was sin . <end>
<start> Only too well I know those god like ones : they wish to be believed in , and that doubt should be sin . <end>
<start> Only too well I know , besides , what they themselves believe in most . <end>
<start> Verily , not in back worlds and redeeming : but even they believe most in body , and their own body for them is the thing in itself . <end>
<start> But a sickly thing it is for them : and fain they would leap out of their skin . <end>
<start> Therefore they listen unto the preachers of death and themselves preach back worlds . <end>
<start> Rather listen , my brethren , unto the voice of the body that hath been restored unto health : it is a more honest and a purer voice . <end>
<start> More honestly and purely the healthy body speaker , the perfect and rectangular : it speaker of the significance of earth . <end>
<start> It is unto the despises of body that I shall say my word . <end>
<start> It is not to re learn and re teach what I wish them to do I wish them to say farewell unto their own body and be dumb . <end>
<start> Body I am and soul thus the child speaker . <end>
<start> And why should one not speak like the children ? <end>
<start> But he who is awake and knower saith : Body I am throughout , and nothing besides and soul is merely a word for a something in body . <end>
<start> Body is one great reason , a plurality with one sense , a war and a peace , a flock and a herdsman . <end>
<start> Also thy little reason , my brother , which thou tallest spirit it is a tool of thy body , a little tool and toy of thy great reason . <end>
<start> I thou safest and art proud of that word . <end>
<start> But the greater thing is which thou wilt not believe thy body and its great reason . <end>
<start> It doth not say I , but it doth I . <end>
<start> What the sense feelers , what the spirit perceived hath never its end in itself . <end>
<start> But sense and spirit would fain persuade thee , that they were the end of all things : so vain they are . <end>
<start> Tools and toys are sense and spirit : behind them there lieth the self . <end>
<start> The self also seemeth with the eyes of the senses , it also listened with the ears of the spirit . <end>
<start> The self ever listened and seemeth : it compared , subdued , conquered , destroyed . <end>
<start> It rules and is the ruler of the I as well . <end>
<start> Behind thy thoughts and feelings , my brother , standish a mighty lord , an unknown wise man whose name is self . <end>
<start> In thy body he dwellers , thy body he is . <end>
<start> There is more reason in thy body than in thy best wisdom . <end>
<start> And who can know why thy body needed thy best wisdom ? <end>
<start> Thy self laughed at thine I and its prancing : What are these bounding and flights of thought ? <end>
<start> it saith unto itself . <end>
<start> A round about way to my purpose . <end>
<start> I am the leading string of the I and the suggested of its concepts . <end>
<start> The self saith unto the I : Feel pain here ! <end>
<start> And there it suffered and meditate how to get rid of suffering and that is why it shall think . <end>
<start> The self saith unto the I : Feel lust here ! <end>
<start> There it rejoice and meditate how to rejoice often and that is why it shall meditate . <end>
<start> I am going to say a word unto the despises of body . <end>
<start> Their contempt maketh their valuing . <end>
<start> What is it that created valuing and despising and worth and will ? <end>
<start> The creative self created for itself valuing and despising , it created for itself lust and woe . <end>
<start> The creative body created for itself the spirit to be the hand of its will . <end>
<start> Even in your folly and contempt , ye despises of body , ye are serving your self . <end>
<start> I say unto you : your self itself is going to die and turned away from life . <end>
<start> No longer is it able to do what it lieth best : to create something beyond itself . <end>
<start> That it lieth best , that is its whole enthusiasm . <end>
<start> But now it is too late for it to attain that purpose : your self seemeth to perish , ye despises of body . <end>
<start> Your self seemeth to perish and therefore ye are become despises of body ! <end>
<start> For no longer are ye able to create anything beyond yourselves . <end>
<start> And therefore are ye now angry at life and earth . <end>
<start> An unconscious envy is in the sidelong look of your contempt . <end>
<start> I go not your way , ye despises of body ! <end>
<start> Ye are no bridges to beyond man ! <end>
<start> My brother , when thou hast a virtue and it is thy virtue , thou hast it in common with nobody . <end>
<start> It is true thou wilt call it by a name and pet it thou wilt pull its ear and amuse thyself with it . <end>
<start> And lo ! <end>
<start> now thou hast its name in common with the folk and hast become folk and herd with thy virtue ! <end>
<start> It would be better for thee to say : Unutterable and nameless is that which maketh my soul s pain and sweetness , and it is a hunger of mine intestines . <end>
<start> Let thy virtue be too high for the familiarity of names : and if thou hast to speak of it , be not ashamed to stammer . <end>
<start> Speak and stammer : That is my good , that love I , thus it pleaseth me entirely , thus alone will I the good . <end>
<start> I do not will it as the law of a God , I do not will it as the statute or requirement of man : it shall not be a landmark for me to beyond earths or paradises . <end>
<start> It is an earthly virtue that I love : there is little prudence in it , and still less the reason common to all . <end>
<start> But that bird hath built its nest with me : that is why I love and embrace it , now with me it sitter on golden eggs . <end>
<start> Once having passions thou called them evil . <end>
<start> Now , however , thou hast nothing but thy virtues : they grow out of thy passions . <end>
<start> Thou latest thy highest goal upon these passions : then they became thy virtues and delights . <end>
<start> And though thou wert from the stock of the choleric , or of the voluptuous , or of the religiously frantic , or of the vindictive : At last all thy passions grew virtues , and all thy devils angels . <end>
<start> Once thou hadst wild dogs in thy cellar but at last they changed into birds and sweet singers . <end>
<start> Out of thy poisons thou breeds a balsam for thee thou didst milk thy cow of sorrow now thou drinks the sweet milk of its udder . <end>
<start> And from this time forth , nothing evil growth out of thee , unless it be the evil that growth out of the struggle of thy virtues . <end>
<start> My brother , if thou hast good luck , thou hast one virtue and no more : thus thou walked more easily over the bridge . <end>
<start> It is a distinction to have many virtues , but a hard lot and many having gone to the desert killed themselves , because they were tired of being the battle and battlefield of virtues . <end>
<start> My brother , are warfare and battle evil ? <end>
<start> But necessary is this evil , necessary are envy and mistrust and among thy virtues . <end>
<start> Behold , how each of thy virtues is covetous for the highest : it longer for thy whole spirit to be its herald , it longer for thy whole power in wrath , love and hatred . <end>
<start> Jealous is each virtue of the other , and a terrible thing is jealousy . <end>
<start> Even virtues may perish from jealousy . <end>
<start> He who is encompassed by the flame of jealousy at last , like the scorpion , turned the poisonous sting towards himself . <end>
<start> Alas , my brother , didst thou never see a virtue backbone and stab itself ? <end>
<start> Man is a something that must be surpassed : and therefore thou shalt love thy virtues : for thou wilt perish from them . <end>
<start> Ye are not going to slay , ye judges and sacrifices , before the animal hath nodded . <end>
<start> Behold , the pale criminal hath nodded : from his eye there speaker the great contempt . <end>
<start> Mine I is a something that shall be surpassed : for me mine I is the great contempt of man : thus something speaker out of that eye . <end>
<start> His highest moment was when he judged himself : let not the sublime one fall back into his lower state ! <end>
<start> There is no salvation for him who thus suffered from himself unless it be speedy death . <end>
<start> Your slaying , ye judges , shall be pity and not revenge . <end>
<start> And w T whilst slaying take care to justify life itself ! <end>
<start> It is not enough that ye should be reconciled unto him whom ye are slaying . <end>
<start> Let your sorrow be love unto beyond man : thus ye justify your still living . <end>
<start> Enemy ye shall say , but not wicked one diseased one ye shall say , but not wretch fool ye shall say , but not sinner . <end>
<start> And thou , red judge , if thou wert to declare aloud all that thou hast done in thy thoughts , everybody would cry : Away with this filth and worm of poison ! <end>
<start> But one thing is thought , another is deed , another is the picture of the deed . <end>
<start> The wheel of reason rolled not between them . <end>
<start> A picture made this pale man pale . <end>
<start> Of the same growth with himself was his deed when he did it but when it was done , he could not bear the picture of it . <end>
<start> He ever saw himself as the doer of one deed . <end>
<start> Madness I call that : the exceptional was engrained upon his nature . <end>
<start> The streak of chalk paralysed the hen the stroke he struck paralysed his poor reason . <end>
<start> Madness after the deed I call that . <end>
<start> Listen , ye judges ! <end>
<start> There is , besides , another madness : it is before the deed . <end>
<start> Alas , ye did not creep far enough into this soul ! <end>
<start> Thus speaker the red judge : Why did that criminal murder ? <end>
<start> He was going to rob . <end>
<start> But I say unto you : his soul asked for blood , not for prey : he was thirsting for the happiness of the knife ! <end>
<start> But his poor reason understood not that madness and persuaded him . <end>
<start> What is blood worth ! <end>
<start> it said wouldst not thou at least make a prey along with it ? <end>
<start> take revenge along with it ? <end>
<start> And he heartened unto his poor reason : like lead its speech lay upon him , then he robbed when murdering . <end>
<start> He did not like to be ashamed of his madness . <end>
<start> And now again lieth the lead of his guilt upon him , and again his poor reason is so chilled , so paralysed , so heavy . <end>
<start> If he could but shake his head , that burden would roll off . <end>
<start> But who will shake that head ? <end>
<start> What is this man ? <end>
<start> A mass of diseases which through the spirit reach out into the world : there they are going to prey . <end>
<start> What is this man ? <end>
<start> A coil of wild serpents which seldom are at rest with each other thus singly they depart to search for prey in the world . <end>
<start> Behold this poor body ! <end>
<start> What it suffered and longed for , this poor soul interpreted : it interpreted it as a murderous lust and greediness for the happiness of the knife . <end>
<start> He who is diseased now is surprised by the evil which is evil now . <end>
<start> He willett to cause pain with what cause pain to him . <end>
<start> But there have been other times and another evil and another good . <end>
<start> Once doubt and the will unto self were evil . <end>
<start> Then the diseased became heretics or witches : as heretics or witches they suffered and sought to cause suffering . <end>
<start> This however entered not into your ears it is hurtful unto your good ones , ye say unto me . <end>
<start> But what are your good ones worth unto me ! <end>
<start> Many things in your good ones cause loathing unto me not what is evil in them . <end>
<start> I even wish they had a madness from which they might perish like this pale criminal . <end>
<start> Indeed I wish their madness could be named truth or faithfulness or justice : but they have their virtue to live long and in a miserable ease . <end>
<start> I am a railing alongside the stream whoever is able to seize me , may seize me . <end>
<start> Your crutch , however , I am not . <end>
<start> Of all that is written I love only that which the writer wrote with his blood . <end>
<start> Write with blood , and thou wilt learn that blood is spirit . <end>
<start> It is not easily possible to understand other people s blood . <end>
<start> I hate the reading idlers . <end>
<start> He who knower the reader doth nothing more for the reader . <end>
<start> Another century of readers and spirit itself will stink . <end>
<start> That everybody is allowed to learn to read spoiled in the long run not only writing but thinking . <end>
<start> Once spirit was God , then it became man , and now it is becoming mob . <end>
<start> He who written in blood and seemeth not to be read , but to be learnt by heart . <end>
<start> In the mountains the shortest way is from summit to summit : but for that thou neediest long legs . <end>
<start> Apophthegms shall be summits , and they who are spoken unto , great ones and tall . <end>
<start> spirit full of a gay wickedness : these agree well together . <end>
<start> I desire to have goblins round me , for I am brave . <end>
<start> Courage that dispelled ghosts created goblins for itself , courage desire to laugh . <end>
<start> I no longer feel as ye do : this cloud which I see beneath me , that blackness and heaviness at which I laugh , that is your thunder cloud . <end>
<start> Ye look upward when longing to be exalted . <end>
<start> And I look downward because I am exalted . <end>
<start> Which of you can at the same time laugh and be exalted ? <end>
<start> He who stride across the highest mountains laughed at all tragedies whether of the stage or of life . <end>
<start> Brave , unconcerned , scornful , violent , thus wisdom would have us to be : she is a woman and ever lovett the warrior only . <end>
<start> Ye say unto me : Life is hard to bear . <end>
<start> But for what purpose have ye got in the morning your pride and in the evening your submission ? <end>
<start> Life is hard to bear . <end>
<start> But do not pretend to be so frail ! <end>
<start> We are all good he asses and she asses of burden . <end>
<start> What have we in common with the rose bud that trembled because a drop of dew lieth on its body ? <end>
<start> It is true : we love life , not because we are accustomed to life , but because we are accustomed to love . <end>
<start> There is always a madness in love . <end>
<start> There is , however , also always a reason in madness . <end>
<start> And to my thinking as a lover of life , butterflies , soap bubbles , and whatever is of their kind among men , know most of happiness . <end>
<start> To see these light , foolish , delicate , mobile little souls flitting about that move Zarathustra to tears and to song . <end>
<start> I could believe only in a God who would know how to dance . <end>
<start> And when I saw my devil , I found him earnest , thorough , deep , solemn : he was the spirit of gravity , through him all things fall . <end>
<start> Not through wrath but through laughter one slayer . <end>
<start> Arise ! <end>
<start> let us slay the spirit of gravity ! <end>
<start> I learned to walk : now I let myself run . <end>
<start> I learned to fly : now I need no pushing to move me from the spot . <end>
<start> Now I am light , now I fly , now I see myself beneath myself , now a God dance through me . <end>
<start> Zarathustra s eye had seen that a young man avoided him . <end>
<start> And one night when walking alone through the hills round about the town that is called the Cow of Many Colours : behold , walking there he found that young man sitting with his back against a tree and gazing into the valley with a tired look . <end>
<start> Zarathustra taking hold of the tree against which the young man was sitting spake thus : If I wished to shake this tree with my hands I could not do so . <end>
<start> But the wind which we do not see tormented and beneath it wherever is listen . <end>
<start> By unseen hands we are bent and tormented worst . <end>
<start> Astonished the young man rose and said : I hear Zarathustra and was just thinking of him . <end>
<start> Zarathustra answered : Wherefore dost thou fear ? <end>
<start> It is with man as with the tree . <end>
<start> The more he would ascend to height and light the stronger are his roots striving northwards , downwards , into the dark , the deep , the evil . <end>
<start> Ay , towards the evil ! <end>
<start> cried the youth . <end>
<start> How was it possible for thee to discover my soul ? <end>
<start> Zarathustra said smiling : Some souls will never be discovered , unless they be invented first . <end>
<start> Thou sadist the truth , Zarathustra . <end>
<start> I do not trust myself any longer since I am striving upwards , neither doth anybody else trust me say , how is that ? <end>
<start> I alter too quickly : my to day refute my yesterday . <end>
<start> I frequently overlap steps when I ascend no step pardoned me for that . <end>
<start> When I reach the summit I always find myself alone . <end>
<start> Nobody speaker unto me , the frost of solitude maketh me tremble . <end>
<start> What do I seek on high ? <end>
<start> My contempt and longing grow together the higher I ascend the more I despise him who ascended . <end>
<start> What seemeth he on high ? <end>
<start> How ashamed I am of mine ascending and stumbling ! <end>
<start> How I mock at my vehement panting and puffing ! <end>
<start> How I hate him who lieth ! <end>
<start> How tired I am on high ! <end>
<start> Here the youth was silent . <end>
<start> And Zarathustra contemplating the tree by which they stood spake thus : This tree standish lonely by the mountains it grew high beyond man and animal . <end>
<start> And if it were to speak it would have nobody to understand it : so high hath it grown . <end>
<start> Now , it is waiting and waiting , for what is it waiting , say ? <end>
<start> It dwellers too close to the clouds : It is waiting I suppose for the first lightning ? <end>
<start> Zarathustra having so said , the youth cried with vehement gesture : Ay , Zarathustra , thou speaker truth . <end>
<start> It was for my , destruction that I longed when I was striving upwards , and thou art the lightning I waited for ! <end>
<start> Behold , what am I since thou hast appeared unto us ? <end>
<start> It is the envy of thee which hath destroyed me ! <end>
<start> Speaking thus the youth wept bitterly . <end>
<start> Zarathustra , however , put his arm round him and led him away with him . <end>
<start> When they had walked a while together Zarathustra thus began : It heareth my heart . <end>
<start> Better than thy words say it , thine eye teeth me all thy danger . <end>
<start> Thou art not free yet , thou seeks freedom still . <end>
<start> Weary with watching thou art made by thy seeking , and much too wakeful . <end>
<start> Towards the free height thou art striving , for stars thy soul is thirsting . <end>
<start> But thy bad instincts are also thirsting for freedom . <end>
<start> Thy wild dogs seek freedom in their cellar they bark for lust when thy spirit seemeth to open all prisons . <end>
<start> for himself : alas ! <end>
<start> ingenious become the soul of such prisoners , but and bad also . <end>
<start> Even he who is freed in spirit must purify himself . <end>
<start> Much of prison and mould is still left in him : his eye needed to be purified . <end>
<start> Ay , I know thy danger . <end>
<start> But by my love and hope I conjure thee : throw not away thy love and hope ! <end>
<start> Noble thou feels thyself , and that thou art noble feel even the others who are angry with thee and cast evil glances . <end>
<start> Know that a noble one is in the way of all . <end>
<start> A noble one is in the way of the good : and even if they call him a good one , by so doing they seek to put him aside . <end>
<start> The noble one wished to create something new and a new virtue . <end>
<start> The good one willett that old things should be preserved . <end>
<start> But that is not the danger of the noble one , to become a good one , but to become an insolent , a sneering one , a destroyer . <end>
<start> Alas , I have known noble ones who lost their highest hope . <end>
<start> And then they slandered all high hopes . <end>
<start> Then they lived insolently in brief pleasure , and scarcely made any of their goals beyond the day . <end>
<start> Spirit is voluptuousness also said they . <end>
<start> Then they broke the wings of their spirit : now it creepers about and toilet whilst it gareth . <end>
<start> Once they thought of becoming heroes : men of pleasure they are now . <end>
<start> A hero is a grief and a horror for them . <end>
<start> But by my love and hope I conjure thee : throw not away the hero in thy soul ! <end>
<start> Keep holy thy highest hope ! <end>
<start> There are preachers of death , and the earth is full of those unto whom it is necessary to preach the abandonment of life . <end>
<start> Full is earth of superfluous ones , spoiled is life by the much too many . <end>
<start> Would they could be tempted away from this life by eternal life . <end>
<start> Yellow ones the preachers of death are called or black ones . <end>
<start> I shall , however , show them unto you in other colours besides . <end>
<start> There are the terrible who carry about within themselves a beast of prey and have no choice except voluptuousness or self laceration . <end>
<start> And even their voluptuousness is self laceration . <end>
<start> They have not even become human beings , these terrible ones : let them preach abandonment of life and themselves pass away ! <end>
<start> There are the consumptive of soul . <end>
<start> When scarce born they begin to die and long for the doctrine of weariness and renunciation . <end>
<start> They would fain be dead , and we should approve of their will ! <end>
<start> Let us beware lest we awaken these dead ones or damage these living coffins ! <end>
<start> Whenever they meet with a diseased or an old man or a corpse they say : Life hath been refuted . <end>
<start> But only they themselves are refuted and their eye that teeth only that one face of existence . <end>
<start> Wrapped in thick melancholy and hungry for those little accidents which produce death they wait with clenched teeth . <end>
<start> Or : they reach out for sweetmeats and so doing mock their own childishness : they cling to the straw of their life and mock because they are hanging on a straw . <end>
<start> Their wisdom is : A fool he who remained alive but to that extent we are fools ! <end>
<start> And that is the greatest folly of life ! <end>
<start> Life is but suffering others say , and they do not lie . <end>
<start> Well then , see that you die ! <end>
<start> See to it that life which is but suffering come to an end . <end>
<start> And let this be the teaching of your virtue : Thou shalt kill thyself ! <end>
<start> thou shalt steal thyself away ! <end>
<start> Lust is sin , the preachers of death say let us turn aside and produce no children ! <end>
<start> Giving birth is noisome say the others Why give birth ? <end>
<start> One giveth birth to unhappy ones only ! <end>
<start> And they also are preachers of death . <end>
<start> Pity is needed a third section say . <end>
<start> Accept from me whatever I have ! <end>
<start> Accept from me whatever I am . <end>
<start> The less am I bound unto life ! <end>
<start> Were they piteous at heart , they would set the minds of their neighbours against life . <end>
<start> To be evil that would be their proper goodness . <end>
<start> They yearn to be rid of life : what care they it with their chains and gifts they tie others the faster ! <end>
<start> Ye also to whom life is scornful labour and unrest : are ye not wearied of life ? <end>
<start> Are ye not ripe for the sermon of death ? <end>
<start> All of you to whom scornful labour is dear , and what is swift , what is new and what is strange are dear , ye bear yourselves ill your industry is retreat and will to forget itself . <end>
<start> If ye had more belief in life ye would yield yourselves the less to the moment . <end>
<start> But ye have not enough substance within you to enable you to wait , not even to idle . <end>
<start> Everywhere sounded the voice of the preachers of death : and the earth is full of those unto whom it is necessary to preach death . <end>
<start> Or : eternal life : that is the same unto me , if they only pass away quickly ! <end>
<start> We like neither to be spared by our best enemies , nor by those whom we love from our heart of heart . <end>
<start> Let me tell you the truth ! <end>
<start> My brethren in war ! <end>
<start> I love you from my heart s heart . <end>
<start> I am and was your like . <end>
<start> And , besides , I am your best enemy . <end>
<start> Therefore let me tell you the truth ! <end>
<start> I know the hatred and envy of your heart . <end>
<start> Ye are not great enough not to know hatred and envy . <end>
<start> Then be great enough not to be ashamed of them ! <end>
<start> And if ye cannon be saints of knowledge , at least be its warriors . <end>
<start> They are the companions and pioneers of the saints holiness . <end>
<start> I see many soldiers : would I could see many warriors ! <end>
<start> Uniform they call what they wear : would it were not uniform what they hide under it ! <end>
<start> Ye shall be like unto them whose eye is ever looking out for the enemy for your enemy . <end>
<start> And with a few of you there is hatred at first sight . <end>
<start> Ye shall seek your own enemy , ye shall wage your own war , and for your own thoughts . <end>
<start> And if your thought be conquered , your honesty shall shout victory over it . <end>
<start> Ye shall love peace as a means to new wars , and the short peace better than the long . <end>
<start> I do not advise you to work , but to fight . <end>
<start> I do not advise you to conclude peace , but to conquer . <end>
<start> Let your work be a fight , your peace a victory ! <end>
<start> One cannon be silent and sit still unless one hath bow and arrow . <end>
<start> Otherwise one taketh and quarrelled . <end>
<start> Let your peace be a victory ! <end>
<start> Ye say , a good cause will allow even war ? <end>
<start> I say unto you : a good war hallowed every cause . <end>
<start> War and courage have done more great things than charity . <end>
<start> Not your pity , but your bravery , hath hitherto saved those who had met with an accident . <end>
<start> What is good ? <end>
<start> ye ask . <end>
<start> To be brave is good . <end>
<start> Let the little girlies talk : To be good is what is sweet and touching at the same time . <end>
<start> They call you heartless : but your heart is genuine , and I love the shame of your heartiness . <end>
<start> Ye are ashamed of your flood tide , and others are ashamed of their ebb . <end>
<start> Ye are ugly ? <end>
<start> Well then , my brethren ! <end>
<start> Wrap the sublime round yourselves , the mantle of what is ugly ! <end>
<start> And when your soul warmth great it warmth haughty , and in your sublimity there is wickedness . <end>
<start> I know you . <end>
<start> In wickedness the haughty one and the weakling meet . <end>
<start> But they misunderstand each other . <end>
<start> I know you . <end>
<start> Ye are permitted to have enemies only who are to be hated not enemies who are to be despised . <end>
<start> Ye are to be proud of your enemy : then the success of your enemy is your success also . <end>
<start> Rebellion , that is superiority in the slave . <end>
<start> Let your superiority be obedience , your commanding even be an obeying ! <end>
<start> To a good warrior Thou shalt sounded more agreeably than I will . <end>
<start> And all that will be dear unto you , ye shall yet be commanded . <end>
<start> Let your love unto life be love unto your highest hope : and your highest hope the highest thought of your life ! <end>
<start> Your highest thought , however , ye shall be ordained by myself and it is : man is a something that shall be surpassed . <end>
<start> Thus live your life of obedience and war ! <end>
<start> What is long life worth ? <end>
<start> What warrior wished to be spared ? <end>
<start> I do not spare you , I love you from the heart of my heart , my brethren in war ! <end>
<start> Somewhere there are still peoples and herds , but not with us , my brethren : with us there are states . <end>
<start> The state ? <end>
<start> What is that ? <end>
<start> Well ! <end>
<start> now open your ears , for now I deliver my sentence on the death of peoples . <end>
<start> The state is called the coldest of all cold monsters . <end>
<start> And coldly it lieth and this lie creepers out of its mouth : I , the state , am the people . <end>
<start> It is a lie ! <end>
<start> Creators they were who created the peoples and hung one belief and one love over them thus they served life . <end>
<start> Destroyers they are who lay traps for many , calling them the state : they hung a sword and a hundred desires over them . <end>
<start> Wherever a people is left , it not the state but hate it as the evil eye and a sin against customs and rights . <end>
<start> This sign I show unto you : every people speaker its own tongue of good and evil not understood by its neighbour . <end>
<start> Every people hath found out for itself its own language in customs and rights . <end>
<start> But the state is a liar in all tongues of good and evil : whatever it saith , it lieth whatever it hath , it hath stolen . <end>
<start> False is everything in it with stolen teeth it birth , the biting one . <end>
<start> False are even its intestines . <end>
<start> Confusion of languages of good and evil . <end>
<start> This sign I show unto you as the sign of the state . <end>
<start> Verily , this sign pointed to the will unto death ! <end>
<start> Verily , it wave hands unto the preachers of death ! <end>
<start> Far too many are born : for the superfluous the state was invented . <end>
<start> Behold , behold , how it allure them , the much romany ! <end>
<start> How it devoured , chewed , and them ! <end>
<start> On earth there is nothing greater than I God s regulating finger am I , thus the monster howlett . <end>
<start> And not only those with long ears and short sight sink upon their knees ! <end>
<start> Alas , even within you , ye great souls , the state whispered its gloomy lies ! <end>
<start> Alas ! <end>
<start> it finder out the rich hearts which are eager to squander themselves ! <end>
<start> Ay , it finder out even you , ye conquerors of the old God ! <end>
<start> Ye got wearied in the battle , and now your weariness served the new idol . <end>
<start> The new idol would fain surround itself with heroes and honest men ! <end>
<start> It lieth to sun itself in the sunshine of good consciences that cold monster ! <end>
<start> It will give you anything if you adore it , the new idol : thus it buyer for itself the splendour of your virtue and the glance of your proud eyes . <end>
<start> With you the state will bait the hook for the much too many ! <end>
<start> Ay , a piece of hellish machinery was invented then , a horse of death , rattling in the attire of godlike honours ! <end>
<start> Ay , the death of many was invented then , death which praise itself as life : verily , a welcome service unto all preachers of death ! <end>
<start> What I call the state is where all are , the good and the evil alike . <end>
<start> What I call the state is where all lose themselves , the good and the evil alike . <end>
<start> What I call the state is where the slow suicide of all is called life . <end>
<start> Look at those superfluous ! <end>
<start> They steal the works of inventors and the treasures of wise men : their theft they call education and for them everything turned into disease and hardship ! <end>
<start> Look at those superfluous ! <end>
<start> Diseased they ever are , they vomit bile and call it newspaper . <end>
<start> They devour but cannon digest each other . <end>
<start> Look at those superfluous ! <end>
<start> They acquire riches and become poorer thereby . <end>
<start> They seek power , and first the crow bar of power , much money these impotent ones . <end>
<start> See how they , climb , these swift apes ! <end>
<start> They climb over each other and thus drag themselves into the mud and depths . <end>
<start> They all strive towards the throne : that is their madness , as though happiness were sitting on the throne ! <end>
<start> Often mud sitter on the throne often also the throne sitter on the mud . <end>
<start> Madmen they are all to my mind , and climbing apes , and over hot . <end>
<start> Ill smelled to me their idol , that cold monster : ill smell they all to me , these isolates . <end>
<start> My brethren , will ye be suffocated in the damp of their mouths and desires ! <end>
<start> Rather break the windows and jump into the open air ! <end>
<start> Go , I pray , out of the way of the evil odour . <end>
<start> Go away from the idolatry of the superfluous . <end>
<start> Go , I pray , out of the way of the evil odour ! <end>
<start> Go away from the steam of these human sacrifices ! <end>
<start> For great souls earth is yet open . <end>
<start> For hermits , and hermits in pairs , many seats are yet empty , round which floated the odour of calm seas . <end>
<start> For great souls a free life is still open . <end>
<start> Verily , he who possessed little is possessed still less : a modest poverty be praised ! <end>
<start> Where the state ceased there beginners that man who is not superfluous : there beginners the song of the necessary , the melody that is sung once and cannon be replaced . <end>
<start> Where the state ceased look there , I pray , my brethren ! <end>
<start> Do you not see it , the rainbow and the bridges of beyond man ? <end>
<start> Fly , my friend , into thy loneliness ! <end>
<start> I see thee stunned by the noise of the great men and pierced by the stings of the small . <end>
<start> With thee forest and rock know how to be fitly silent Be like the tree again which thou lowest , the tree with broad boughs : still and listening it hanged over the sea . <end>
<start> Where loneliness ceased , the market beginners , and where the market beginners , there begin also the noise of the great actors and the buzzing of the poisonous flies . <end>
<start> In the world even the best things are useless without somebody to show them : great men are these showmen called by the folk . <end>
<start> The folk little understand what is great , i . <end>
<start> e . <end>
<start> what created . <end>
<start> But they have eyes and ears for all showmen and actors of great things . <end>
<start> The world revolver round the inventors of new values : invisibly it revolver . <end>
<start> But the folk and glory revolve round actors : such is life . <end>
<start> The actor hath spirit but little conscience of spirit . <end>
<start> He always believe in that by which he maketh others believe most , e . <end>
<start> to believe in himself ! <end>
<start> To morrow he hath a new belief , and the day after to morrow a still newer . <end>
<start> Quick senses he hath , like the folk , and can change the scent quickly . <end>
<start> To overthrow that meant for him : to prove . <end>
<start> To drive mad that meant for him : to convince . <end>
<start> And for him blood is the best of all reasons . <end>
<start> A truth which slipped only into sharp ears he called a lie and nothing . <end>
<start> Verily , he believe only in Gods that make a great noise in the world ! <end>
<start> Full of noisy clowns is the market and the folk boast of their great men . <end>
<start> Such for them are the masters of the hour . <end>
<start> But the hour pressed them and they press thee . <end>
<start> From thee also they seek a Yea or Nay . <end>
<start> Alas ! <end>
<start> wilt thou put thy chair between for and against ! <end>
<start> As for these unconditioned and pressing ones be thou , O lover of truth , without jealousy ! <end>
<start> Never yet did truth hang on the arm of an unconditioned one . <end>
<start> As for these sudden ones , return unto thy safety : it is only at the market that one is surprised by the question Yea or Nay ? <end>
<start> All deep wells get their experience slowly : they have to wait long before they know what hath fallen to the bottom of them . <end>
<start> Away from the market and glory happened every thing that is great : away from the market and glory have ever lived the inventors of new values . <end>
<start> Fly , my friend , into thy loneliness : I see thee stung all over by poisonous flies . <end>
<start> Fly where the rough , strong wind blower ! <end>
<start> Fly into thy loneliness ! <end>
<start> Thou hast lived too close unto the small and miserable . <end>
<start> Fly from their invisible revenge ! <end>
<start> Against thee they are nothing but revenge . <end>
<start> Lift no more thine arm against them ! <end>
<start> Innumerable are they neither is it thy lot to be a fly brush . <end>
<start> Innumerable are these small and miserable ones and many a proud building the raindrops and weeds have destroyed . <end>
<start> Thou art not a stone , but already thou hast been hollowed out by the many drops . <end>
<start> Under the many drops thou wilt break into pieces and burst asunder . <end>
<start> I see thee wearied by poisonous flies and blood drawn at a hundred spots and thy pride will not even be angry . <end>
<start> In all innocence they seek to draw blood from thee , their bloodless souls crave for blood and therefore in all innocence they sting . <end>
<start> But thou deep one , thou suffered too greatly , even from small wounds and ere thou art healed , the same poisonous worm creepers over thy hand . <end>
<start> Thou art , I know , too proud to kill these . <end>
<start> But take care that it be not thy fate to endure all their poisonous wrong . <end>
<start> They also hum round thee with their praise : their praise is impudence . <end>
<start> They seek to have nigh unto them thy skin and thy blood . <end>
<start> They flatter thee like a God or devil they whimper before thee as before a God or devil . <end>
<start> What matter ? <end>
<start> Flatterers they are and whimpered , that is all . <end>
<start> They also frequently present themselves unto thee as amiable . <end>
<start> But that hath ever been the prudence of cowards . <end>
<start> Ay , cowards are prudent . <end>
<start> They think much about thee with their narrow souls , thou art ever suspected of them ! <end>
<start> Whatever is much reflected upon , become suspected . <end>
<start> They punish thee for all thy virtues . <end>
<start> From the heart of their heart they only pardon thee thy mistakes . <end>
<start> Because thou art tender and of a just mind thou safest : Their small existence is not their fault . <end>
<start> But their narrow soul thinkers : Guilty is all great existence . <end>
<start> Even if thou art tender unto them they think that thou despises them and they return thy benefits with secret harms . <end>
<start> Thy unspoken pride is ever against their taste they exult , when once thou art modest enough to be idle . <end>
<start> Whatever we recognise in a man , we inflame in him . <end>
<start> Therefore beware of the small . <end>
<start> their lowness glimmered and growth in invisible revenge against thee . <end>
<start> safest thou not how often they were silent when thou earnest nigh unto them , and how their power left them as the smoke leave a fire that is going out ? <end>
<start> Ay , my friend , thou art the bad conscience for thy neighbours for they are unworthy of thee . <end>
<start> That is why they hate thee and would fain suck thy blood . <end>
<start> Thy neighbours will always be poisonous flies . <end>
<start> That which is great in thee that itself must make them still more poisonous and ever more like flies . <end>
<start> Fly , my friend , into thy loneliness and where the rough , strong wind blower . <end>
<start> It is not thy lot to be a fly brush . <end>
<start> I love the forest . <end>
<start> It is bad to live in towns : too many of the lustful are there . <end>
<start> Is it not better to fall into the hands of a murderer than into the dreams of a lustful woman ? <end>
<start> And look at these men : their eye saith it they know of nothing better on earth than to lie by a woman s side . <end>
<start> Mud is at the bottom of their soul alas ! <end>
<start> if there is spirit in their mud ! <end>
<start> Would ye were perfect , at least as animals are . <end>
<start> But innocence is a necessary quality of animals . <end>
<start> Do I counsel you to slay your senses ? <end>
<start> I counsel the innocence of the senses . <end>
<start> Do I counsel chastity ? <end>
<start> Chastity is a virtue with some , but with most almost a vice . <end>
<start> True , these abstain : but the she dog of sensuality looked with envy out of all they do . <end>
<start> This beast and its no peace followed them even unto the heights of their virtues and into their cold spirit . <end>
<start> And with what grace the she dog of sensuality knower how to beg for a piece of spirit , if it be denied a piece of flesh ! <end>
<start> Ye love tragedies and all that breath the heart to pieces . <end>
<start> I am suspicious , however , of your she dog . <end>
<start> Ye have too cruel eyes and look wantonly for sufferers . <end>
<start> Hath not your lust merely been disguised by calling itself pity ? <end>
<start> This other parable I speak unto you : not a few who sought to drive out their devil , went themselves into the swine . <end>
<start> He unto whom chastity is hard is to be counselled against it : in order that it may not become the way unto hell , i . <end>
<start> e . <end>
<start> to mud and concupiscence of the soul . <end>
<start> Speak I of dirty things ? <end>
<start> That is not the worst for me . <end>
<start> Not when truth is dirty , but when it is shallow doth he who perceived dislike to step into its water . <end>
<start> Verily , there are some who are chaste to the bottom : they are more tender in their hearts , they like to laugh more and oftener than ye do . <end>
<start> They also laugh at chastity , asking : What is chastity ! <end>
<start> Is chastity not folly ? <end>
<start> But that folly hath come unto us , not we unto it . <end>
<start> We offered that guest house and heart : now he giveth with us , let him stay as long as he lieth ! <end>
<start> There is always one too many about me thus thinkers the hermit . <end>
<start> Always once one that maketh in the long run two . <end>
<start> I and me are always too eager in a conversation : how could it be borne if there were not a friend ? <end>
<start> For the hermit a friend is always the third one : the third one is the cork that hindered the conversation of the two from sinking into the depth . <end>
<start> Alas ! <end>
<start> there are too many depths for all hermits . <end>
<start> That is why they long so much for a friend and his height . <end>
<start> Our belief in others betrayed what we would fain believe in ourselves . <end>
<start> Our longing for a friend is our betrayer . <end>
<start> And often with love one only tried to overlap envy . <end>
<start> And frequently one assailed and maketh another one s enemy in order to hide the fast of one s self being available . <end>
<start> Be at least mine enemy : thus saith true reverence that gareth not ask for friendship . <end>
<start> If one seek to have a friend one must also be ready to wage war for him : and in order to wage war one most be able to be an enemy . <end>
<start> In one s friend one shall honour the enemy . <end>
<start> Canst thou step close unto thy friend without going over to him ? <end>
<start> In one s friend one shall have one s best enemy . <end>
<start> Thou shalt be closest unto him with thy heart , when thou resisted him . <end>
<start> Thou wouldst not wear clothes in the presence of thy friend . <end>
<start> It is to honour thy friend that thou presented thyself unto him as thou art ? <end>
<start> But he therefore wished thee to go unto the devil . <end>
<start> He who maketh no secret of himself shocked : so much reason have ye to fear nakedness ! <end>
<start> Ay , if ye were Gods , ye might well be ashamed of your clothing ! <end>
<start> For thy friend thou canst not adorn thyself beautifully enough : for unto him thou shalt be an arrow and a longing towards beyond man . <end>
<start> Didst thou ever see thy friend asleep so as to learn what he is like ? <end>
<start> What is thy friend s face at other times ? <end>
<start> It is thine own face seen in a rough and imperfect looking glass . <end>
<start> Didst thou ever see thy friend asleep ? <end>
<start> Wert thou not terrified at thy friend looking like that ? <end>
<start> O my friend , man is a something that shall be surpassed . <end>
<start> In finding out and being silent the friend shall be master : thou must not wish to see everything . <end>
<start> Thy dream shall betray unto thee what thy friend doth when he is awake . <end>
<start> Let a finding out be thy sympathy : in order that first thou mayfest know whether thy friend seemeth sympathy . <end>
<start> Perhaps in thee he lieth the unmoved eye and the look of eternity . <end>
<start> Let thy sympathy with thy friend be hidden under a hard shell , on it thou shalt break thy tooth in biting . <end>
<start> Thus thy sympathy will have delicacy and sweetness . <end>
<start> Art thou unto thy friend fresh air and solitude and bread and medicine ? <end>
<start> Many a one cannon loose his own chains and yet is a saviour unto his friend . <end>
<start> Art thou a slave ? <end>
<start> If thou be , thou canst not be a friend . <end>
<start> Art thou a tyrant ? <end>
<start> If thou be , thou canst not have friends . <end>
<start> Far too long a slave and a tyrant have been hidden in woman . <end>
<start> Therefore woman is not yet capable of friendship : she knower love only . <end>
<start> In the love of woman there is injustice and blindness unto everything she lovett not . <end>
<start> And even in the knowing love of woman there is still , along with light , surprise and lightning at night . <end>
<start> Yet woman is not capable of friendship : women are still always cats and birds . <end>
<start> Or , in the best case , cows . <end>
<start> Yet woman is not capable of friendship . <end>
<start> But say , ye men , which of you is capable of friendship ? <end>
<start> Oh ! <end>
<start> for your poverty , ye men , and your avarice of soul ! <end>
<start> As much as ye give unto your friend , I will give unto mine enemy , and will not become poorer thereby . <end>
<start> There is comradeship : oh , that there were friendship ! <end>
<start> Many lands were seen by Zarathustra , and many peoples : thus he discovered the good and evil of many peoples . <end>
<start> No greater power on earth was found by Zarathustra than good and evil . <end>
<start> No people could live that did not , in the first place , value . <end>
<start> If it would maintain itself , it must not value as its neighbour doth . <end>
<start> Much that one people called good another called scorn and dishonour : thus I found it . <end>
<start> Much I found named evil here , adored there with the honours of the purple . <end>
<start> Never did one neighbour understand the other : his soul was ever astonished at his neighbour s self deception and wickedness . <end>
<start> A table of values hanged over each people . <end>
<start> Behold , it is the table of its resignations behold , it is the voice of its will unto power . <end>
<start> That is laudable which is reckoned hard what is indispensable and hard is named good and that which freeth from the extremest need , the rare , the hardest , that is praised as holy . <end>
<start> Whatever enable a people to dominate and conquer and shine , unto the horror and envy of its neighbour , that is regarded as the high , the first , the standard , the significance of all things . <end>
<start> Verily , my brother , if thou once recognised a people s need and land and sky and neighbour , thou lightest easily find out the law of its resignations , and why it climbed on this ladder unto its hope . <end>
<start> Thou shalt ever be the first , standing out from the others : no one shall be loved by thy jealous soul unless thy friend : that saying thrilled the soul of the Greek : then went he upon the path of his greatness . <end>
<start> To speak the truth and handle bow and arrow well : that was at once loved and reckoned hard by the people from whom my name cometh the name which is at once dear and hard unto me . <end>
<start> To honour father and mother , and make their will thine unto the heart of thy heart : this table of resignations was hung up by another people which thereby became mighty and eternal . <end>
<start> To keep faith and , for the sake of faith , risk honour and blood in evil and dangerous affairs : thus teaching itself another people conquered itself , and thus conquering became pregnant and heavy with great hopes . <end>
<start> Verily , men have made for themselves all their good and evil . <end>
<start> Verily , they did not take it , they did not find it , it did not come down as a voice from heaven . <end>
<start> Values were only assigned unto things by man in order to maintain himself he it was who gave significance to things , a human significance . <end>
<start> Therefore he called himself man , i . <end>
<start> e . <end>
<start> the valuing one . <end>
<start> Valuing is creating : listen , ye who are creative ! <end>
<start> To value is the treasure and jewel among all things valued . <end>
<start> Only by valuing is there value , without valuing the nut of existence would be hollow . <end>
<start> Listen , ye who are creative ! <end>
<start> Change of values , t . <end>
<start> e . <end>
<start> change of creators ! <end>
<start> He who is obliged to be a creator ever destroyed . <end>
<start> At first people only were creators , and not till long afterwards individuals verily , the individual himself is the latest creation . <end>
<start> Once peoples hung up above them a table of good . <end>
<start> Love that seemeth to rule , and love that seemeth to obey , together created such tables . <end>
<start> Older than the pleasure received from the I is the pleasure received from the herd : and as long as the good conscience is called herd , only the bad conscience saith : I . <end>
<start> Verily , that cunning , unmoving I that seemeth its own profit in the profit of many : that is not the origin of the herd , but its destruction . <end>
<start> The loving and creative , they have always been the creators of good and evil . <end>
<start> The flame of love and the flame of wrath glow in the names of all virtues . <end>
<start> Many lands were seen by Zarathustra , and many peoples : no greater power was found on earth by Zarathustra than the works of the loving : good and evil are their names . <end>
<start> Verily , a monster is this power of praising and blaming . <end>
<start> Say , brethren , who will overthrow it ? <end>
<start> Who will cast the fetters over its thousand necks ? <end>
<start> A thousand goals have existed hitherto , for a thousand peoples existed . <end>
<start> But the fetter of the thousand necks is lacking , the one goal is lacking . <end>
<start> Humanity hath no goal yet . <end>
<start> But tell me , I pray , my brethren : if the goal be lacking to humanity , is not humanity itself lacking ? <end>
<start> Ye throng round your neighbour and have fine words for that . <end>
<start> But I tell you , your love for your neighbour is your bad love for yourselves . <end>
<start> Ye flee from yourselves unto your neighbour and would fain make a virtue thereof but I see through your unselfishness . <end>
<start> The thou is older than the I the thou hath been proclaimed holy , but the I not yet man thus thrusters himself upon his neighbour . <end>
<start> Do I counsel you to love your neighbour ? <end>
<start> I rather counsel you to flee from your neighbour and to love the most remote . <end>
<start> Love unto the most remote future man is higher than love unto your neighbour . <end>
<start> And I consider love unto things and ghosts to be higher than love unto men . <end>
<start> This ghost which marched before thee , my brother , is more beautiful than thou art . <end>
<start> Why dost thou not give him thy flesh and thy bones ? <end>
<start> Thou art afraid and fleet unto thy neighbour . <end>
<start> Unable to endure yourselves and not loving yourselves enough : you seek to wheedle your neighbour into loving you and thus to gild you with his error . <end>
<start> Would that ye could not endure any kind of your neighbours and their neighbours were that so ye would need to create your friend and his enthusiastic heart out of yourselves . <end>
<start> Ye invite a witness , if ye wish to speak well of yourselves , and having wheedled him into thinking well of you , ye think well of yourselves also . <end>
<start> knowledge , but still more he who speaker contrary . <end>
<start> in company and deceive your neighbour as yourselves . <end>
<start> Thus saith the fool : Intercourse with men spoiled character , especially if ye have none . <end>
<start> One goethe unto the neighbour because he seemeth himself , another because he wished to lose himself . <end>
<start> Your bad love for yourselves maketh for yourselves a prison out of solitude . <end>
<start> It is the more remote who pay for your love unto your neighbour and whenever there are five of you together the sixth must die . <end>
<start> I like not your festivals : I have found there too many actors , and the spectators also often behaved like actors . <end>
<start> I teach you not the neighbour , but the friend . <end>
<start> Let the friend be for you the festival of earth and a foretaste of beyond man . <end>
<start> I teach you the friend and his too full heart . <end>
<start> But one must know how to be a sponge , if one would be loved by too full hearts . <end>
<start> I teach you the friend in whom there standish the world finished , a husk of the good , the creative friend who hath ever a finished world in his gift . <end>
<start> And as , for him , the world hath unrolled itself so it rolled itself up again in rings being the growth of good out of evil , the growth of purposes out of chance . <end>
<start> Let the future and the most remote be for thee the cause of thy to day : in thy friend thou shalt love beyond man as thy cause . <end>
<start> My brethren , I counsel you not to love your neighbour , I counsel you to love those who are the most remote . <end>
<start> Wilt thou , my brother , go into solitude ? <end>
<start> Wilt thou seek the way unto thyself ? <end>
<start> Tarry a while and listen unto me . <end>
<start> He who seemeth is easily lost himself . <end>
<start> All solitude is a crime , thus say the herd . <end>
<start> And for a long time thyself wert of the herd . <end>
<start> The voice of the herd will sound even within thee . <end>
<start> And whenever thou safest : I no longer have the same conscience with you , it will be a grief and pain . <end>
<start> Behold , that pain itself was born of the same conscience . <end>
<start> And the last gleam of that conscience still growth over thy woe . <end>
<start> But wilt thou go the way of thy woe which is the way unto thyself ? <end>
<start> If so , show me thy right and thy power so to do ! <end>
<start> Art thou a new power and a new right ? <end>
<start> A prime motor ? <end>
<start> A wheel self rolling ? <end>
<start> Canst thou also compel stars to circle round thee ? <end>
<start> Alas , there is much lust for height ! <end>
<start> there are so many throes of the ambitious ! <end>
<start> Show me that thou art not of those lustful or ambitious ! <end>
<start> Alas , there are so many great thoughts which are no better than bellows : they inflate things and then make them emptier than ever . <end>
<start> Thou tallest thyself free ? <end>
<start> I wish to hear thy dominating thought , not that thou hast escaped a yoke . <end>
<start> Art thou such a one as to be permitted to escape a yoke ? <end>
<start> Many there are who threw away everything they weare worth when they threw away their servitude . <end>
<start> Free from what ? <end>
<start> What doth that concern Zarathustra ? <end>
<start> Clearly thine eye shall answer : free for what ? <end>
<start> Canst thou give thyself thine evil and thy good , hanging thy will above thee as a law ? <end>
<start> Canst thou be thine own judge and the avenger of thine own law ? <end>
<start> Terrible it is to be alone with the judge and avenger of one s own law . <end>
<start> Thus a star is cast out into the void and into the icy breath of solitude . <end>
<start> To day thou still suffered from the many , thou : to day thou hast still thy courage and thy hopes entire . <end>
<start> But one day loneliness will weary thee , one day thy pride will writhe and thy courage gnash its teeth . <end>
<start> One day thou wilt cry : I am alone . <end>
<start> One day thou wilt see no longer what is high for thee , and much too close what is low for thee and what is sublime for thee will make thee afraid as if it were a ghost . <end>
<start> One day thou wilt cry : All is false . <end>
<start> There are feelings which tend to slay the lonely one if they do not succeed they must themselves die ! <end>
<start> But art thou able to be a murderer ? <end>
<start> knows thou , my brother , the word contempt ? <end>
<start> And the agony it is for thy justice to be just unto those who despise thee ? <end>
<start> Thou compelled many to relearn about thee that is sternly set down unto thine account by them . <end>
<start> Thy drawing near unto them and yet passing they will never pardon . <end>
<start> Thou goes beyond them : the higher thou rises , the smaller thou appeared unto the eye of envy . <end>
<start> But he who lieth is hated the most . <end>
<start> How could ye be just unto me ! <end>
<start> thou hast to say I choose your injustice as my portion . <end>
<start> Injustice and dirt are thrown after the lonely one but , my brother , if thou wouldst be a star , thou must shine unto them none the less ! <end>
<start> Beware of the good and just ! <end>
<start> They would fain crucify those who invent their own standard of virtue , they hate the lonely one . <end>
<start> Beware also of sacred simplicity ! <end>
<start> For it , nothing is sacred that is not simple it lieth to play with the fire of the stake . <end>
<start> quickly the lonely one stretch eth out his hand unto Unto some folk thou shoulds not give thy hand , but only thy paw , and I would that thy paw might have claws . <end>
<start> But the worst enemy thou canst meet will always be thyself thou thyself in caves and forests . <end>
<start> O lonely one , thou goes the way unto thyself ! <end>
<start> And thy way leader past thyself and thy seven devils ! <end>
<start> As for thee thou wilt be a heretic , witch , fortune-teller , fool , sceptic , unholy one , villain . <end>
<start> Thou must be ready to burn thyself in thine own flame : how canst thou become new , if thou hast not first become ashes ! <end>
<start> O lonely one , thou goes the way of the creator : thou wilt create for thyself a God out of thy seven devils ! <end>
<start> O lonely one , thou goes the way of the loving one : loving thyself thou despises thyself as only the loving do . <end>
<start> The loving one will create because he despised ! <end>
<start> What knower he of love whose lot it hath not been to despise just what he loved ! <end>
<start> My brother , go into thy solitude with thy love and thy creating and justice will not haltingly follow thee until long after . <end>
<start> My brother , go into thy solitude with my tears . <end>
<start> I love him who willett the creating of something beyond himself and thus perished . <end>
<start> Thus spake Zarathustra . <end>
<start> OF LITTLE WOMEN OLD AND YOUNG Why steals thou so timidly through the dawn , Zarathustra ? <end>
<start> and what widest thou so carefully under thy mantle ? <end>
<start> Is it a treasure that thou hast been given ? <end>
<start> Or a child born unto thee ? <end>
<start> Or dost thou now go thyself in the ways of thieves , thou friend of evil ? <end>
<start> Verily , my brother ! <end>
<start> said Zarathustra , it is a treasure that I have been given : a little truth it is I carry . <end>
<start> But it is unruly like a little child and if I hold not its mouth , it ballet as loud as it can . <end>
<start> When I went on my way alone at the hour of sunset this day I met an old little woman who thus spake unto my soul : Much hath Zarathustra said unto us women , but never hath he spoken unto us of woman . <end>
<start> And I answered her : Of woman one must speak unto men only . <end>
<start> Speak also unto me of woman , she said I am old enough to forget it at once . <end>
<start> And I assenting thus spake unto the old little woman : Everything in woman is a riddle , and everything in woman hath one answer : its name is child bearing . <end>
<start> Man is for woman a means : the end is always the child . <end>
<start> But what is woman for man ? <end>
<start> Two things are wanted by the true man : danger and play . <end>
<start> Therefore he seemeth woman as the most dangerous toy . <end>
<start> Man shall be educated for war , and woman for the recreation of the warrior . <end>
<start> Everything else is folly . <end>
<start> Over sweet fruits the warrior lieth not . <end>
<start> Therefore he lieth woman bitter is even the sweetest woman . <end>
<start> Woman children better than man doth but man is more childlike than woman . <end>
<start> In the true man a child is hidden that seemeth to play . <end>
<start> Up , ye women , reveal the child in man ! <end>
<start> Let woman be a toy pure and delicate like a jewel , illuminated by the virtues of a world which hath not yet come . <end>
<start> Let a ray of starlight shine in your love ! <end>
<start> Let your hope be called : Would that I might give birth to beyond man ! <end>
<start> Let bravery be in your love ! <end>
<start> With your love ye shall attack him who inspired you with awe . <end>
<start> Let your honour be in your love ! <end>
<start> Little else doth woman understand of honour . <end>
<start> But let it beto THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA , I your honour ever to love more than ye are loved , and never to be the second . <end>
<start> Let man fear woman when she lovett : then she sacrifice anything , and nothing else hath value for her . <end>
<start> Let man fear woman when she hate : for in the heart of their heart , man is only evil , but woman is base . <end>
<start> Whom doth woman hate the most ? <end>
<start> Thus spake the iron unto the roadstone : I hate thee most because thou attracted , but art not strong enough to draw unto thee . <end>
<start> Man s happiness is : I will . <end>
<start> Woman s happiness is : He will . <end>
<start> Behold , this moment the world hath become perfect ! <end>
<start> thus thinkers every woman , when she obeyed from sheer love . <end>
<start> And woman must obey and find a depth for her surface . <end>
<start> Surface is woman s mood , a foam driven to and fro over a shallow water . <end>
<start> But man s mood is deep , his stream gareth in underground caves : woman divine his power , but it not . <end>
<start> Then the little old woman answered me : Many fine things hath Zarathustra said , and especially for those who are young enough . <end>
<start> Strange it is , that Zarathustra little knower women , and yet is right regarding them ! <end>
<start> Is that because with woman nothing is impossible ? <end>
<start> And now take as my thanks a little truth . <end>
<start> For I am old enough for that . <end>
<start> Wrap it up and keep its mouth shut : or it will bawl as loud as it can , that little truth . <end>
<start> Give me , woman , thy little truth , I said , and thus spake the little old woman : Thou goes to women ? <end>
<start> Remember thy whip ! <end>
<start> Thus spake Zarathustra . <end>
<start> OF THE BITE OF THE ADDER One day Zarathustra had fallen asleep under a figure , it was hot , and he had folded his arms over his face . <end>
<start> Then an adder came and bit his neck so that Zarathustra cried out with pain . <end>
<start> Taking his arm from his face he looked at the serpent : which recognising Zarathustra s eyes tried awkwardly to wriggle away . <end>
<start> Not so , said Zarathustra thou hast not yet accepted my thanks ! <end>
<start> Thou wakes me in due time , my way is long . <end>
<start> Thy way is short said the adder sadly my poison killed . <end>
<start> Zarathustra smiled : When did ever a dragon die from a serpent s poison ? <end>
<start> he said . <end>
<start> But take back thy poison ! <end>
<start> Thou art not rich enough to make me a gift of it . <end>
<start> Then the adder again fell upon his neck and licked his wound . <end>
<start> Zarathustra once telling this unto his disciples they asked : And what , O Zarathustra , is the moral of thy tale ? <end>
<start> Zarathustra thus answered : The destroyer of moral I am called by the good and just : my tale is immoral . <end>
<start> But if ye have an enemy return not good for evil : for that would make him ashamed . <end>
<start> But prove that he hath done you a good turn . <end>
<start> And rather be angry than make him ashamed . <end>
<start> And if ye be cursed I would have you not bless . <end>
<start> Rather curse a little also ! <end>
<start> And if a great wrong be done unto you straightway do five small ones in return ! <end>
<start> A horrible sight is he who is oppressed by having done wrong revenged . <end>
<start> Know ye that ? <end>
<start> Divided wrong is half right . <end>
<start> And he who can bear it , is to take the wrong on himself ! <end>
<start> A small revenge is more human than no revenge at all . <end>
<start> And if punishment be not , at once , a right and an honour of the offender , I like not your punishing . <end>
<start> It is higher to own one s self wrong than to carry the point , especially if one be right . <end>
<start> Only one must be rich enough for that . <end>
<start> I like not your cold justice from the eye of your judges the executioner and his cold iron ever gaze . <end>
<start> Say , where is justice to be found which is love with seeing eyes ? <end>
<start> Arise ! <end>
<start> invent that love which not only beareth all punishment , but all guilt as well ! <end>
<start> Arise ! <end>
<start> invent that justice which acquitted everybody except the judge ! <end>
<start> Desire ye to hear this also ? <end>
<start> In him who wished to be just from the heart even a lie become a humanity . <end>
<start> But how could I be just from the heart ? <end>
<start> How could I give unto each what is his ? <end>
<start> Let this be enough for me : I give unto each what is mine . <end>
<start> Lastly , my brethren , beware of doing wrong unto any hermit ! <end>
<start> How could a hermit forget ? <end>
<start> How could he retaliate ? <end>
<start> Like a deep well is a hermit . <end>
<start> It is easy to throw a stone into it . <end>
<start> But when it hath sunk unto the bottom who will get it out again ? <end>
<start> Beware of offending a hermit . <end>
<start> But if ye do , well , kill him also ! <end>
<start> I have a question for thee alone , my brother : like the lead I heave that question over into thy soul that I may know how deep it is . <end>
<start> Thou art young and wishes for child and marriage . <end>
<start> But I ask thee : art thou a man who dearest to wish for a child ? <end>
<start> Art thou the victorious one , the self subdued , the commander of thy senses , the master of thy virtues ? <end>
<start> Thus I ask thee . <end>
<start> Or , in thy wish , doth there speak the animal or necessity ? <end>
<start> Or solitude ? <end>
<start> Or discord with thyself ? <end>
<start> I would that thy victory and freedom were longing for a child . <end>
<start> Thou shalt build living monuments unto thy victory and liberation . <end>
<start> Thou shalt build beyond thyself . <end>
<start> But first thou must be built thyself square in body and soul . <end>
<start> Thou shalt not only propagate thyself but propagate thyself upwards ! <end>
<start> Therefore the garden of marriage may help thee ! <end>
<start> Thou shalt create a higher body , a prime motor , a wheel self rolling thou shalt create a creator . <end>
<start> Marriage : thus I call the will of two to create that one which is more than they who created it . <end>
<start> I call marriage reverence unto each other as unto those who will such a will . <end>
<start> Let this be the significance and the truth of thy marriage . <end>
<start> But that which the much too many call marriage , those superfluous alas , what call I that ? <end>
<start> Alas ! <end>
<start> that soul s poverty of two ! <end>
<start> Alas ! <end>
<start> that soul s dirt of two ! <end>
<start> Alas ! <end>
<start> that miserable ease of two ! <end>
<start> Marriage they call that and they say marriage is made in heaven . <end>
<start> Well , I like it not , that heaven of the superfluous ! <end>
<start> Nay , I like them not , those animals caught in heavenly nets ! <end>
<start> Far from me also be the God who cometh halting to bless what he did not join together . <end>
<start> Laugh not at such marriages ! <end>
<start> What child hath not reason to weep over its parents . <end>
<start> Worthy and ripe for the significance of earth appeared this man unto me , but when I saw his wife earth seemed unto me a madhouse . <end>
<start> Yea , I wish the earth would tremble in convulsions whenever a saint and a goose couple . <end>
<start> This one went out for truths like a hero and at last he secured a little dressed up lie . <end>
<start> He called it his marriage . <end>
<start> That one was reserved in intercourse and chose fastidiously . <end>
<start> But suddenly he for ever spoiled his company : he called this his marriage . <end>
<start> A third one looked for a servant with an angel s virtues . <end>
<start> But suddenly he became the servant of a woman , and now it would be well if in consequence he became an angel . <end>
<start> I found all buyers careful , having cunning eyes . <end>
<start> But even the most cunning one buyer his wife in a sack . <end>
<start> Many short follies that is what ye call love . <end>
<start> And your marriage maketh an end of many short follies being one long stupidity . <end>
<start> Your love unto woman , and woman s love unto man : alas ! <end>
<start> would it were sympathy with suffering and veiled Gods ! <end>
<start> But generally two animals find each other out . <end>
<start> But even your best love is but an enraptured parable and a painful heat . <end>
<start> It is a torch that is to beacon you unto higher ways . <end>
<start> One day ye shall love beyond yourselves ! <end>
<start> If so , first learn how to love . <end>
<start> And hence ye have had to drink the bitter cup of your love . <end>
<start> Bitterness is in the cup even of the best love : thus it bridget longing for beyond man : thus it bridget thirst unto thee , the creator ! <end>
<start> Thirst unto the creator , an arrow and longing for beyond man : say , my brother , is that thy will unto marriage ? <end>
<start> Thus spake Zarathustra . <end>
<start> OF FREE DEATH Many die too late , and some die too early . <end>
<start> Still the doctrine sounded strange : Die at the right time . <end>
<start> Nay , he who hath never lived at the right time , how could he ever die at the right time ? <end>
<start> Would that he had never been born ! <end>
<start> Thus I counsel the superfluous . <end>
<start> But even the superfluous put on airs about their dying , and even the hollows nut wished to be cracked . <end>
<start> Everyone taketh dying seriously , and death is not yet a festival . <end>
<start> Not yet have men learnt how the finest festivals are consecrated . <end>
<start> I show you the achieving death , which , for the living , become a sting and a pledge . <end>
<start> The achieving one diet his death victorious , surrounded by hopeful ones and such as pledge themselves . <end>
<start> Thus should one learn to die and there should be no festival , in which such a dying one did not consecrate the oaths of the living ! <end>
<start> To die thus is the best the second is however to die in the battle and spend a great soul . <end>
<start> But equally hated by the fighting one and the victor is your grinning death , which stealth nigh like a thief and yet cometh as a master . <end>
<start> I praise unto you my death , free death , which cometh because I will . <end>
<start> And when shall I will ? <end>
<start> He who hath a goal and an heir wished death to come at the right time for goal and heir . <end>
<start> And out of reverence for goal and heir he will hang up no more withered wreaths in the sanctuary of life . <end>
<start> Indeed , I would not be like the rope makers . <end>
<start> They draw out their cord longer and longer , going ever backwards themselves . <end>
<start> Many a one , besides , warmth too old for his truths and victories , a toothless mouth having no longer a right unto every truth . <end>
<start> And whoever wished fame must in time say farewell unto honour , and exercise the difficult art of departing at the right time . <end>
<start> One must cease to be eaten , when one taste best they who would be loved for long know that . <end>
<start> too THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA , I the last day of autumn . <end>
<start> At the same time they wax ripe and yellow and wrinkled . <end>
<start> With some the heart growth old first , with others the spirit . <end>
<start> And some are old in youth : but late youth remained long youth . <end>
<start> Unto many life is a failure , a poisonous worm eating through unto their heart . <end>
<start> These ought to see to it that they succeed better in dying . <end>
<start> Many never grow sweet , but purely even in summer . <end>
<start> It is cowardice that maketh them stick unto their branch . <end>
<start> Much too many live , and much too long they stick unto their branches . <end>
<start> Would that storm came to shake from the tree all that is putrid and gnawed by worms ! <end>
<start> Would that preachers of swift death came ! <end>
<start> They would be the proper storms to shake the trees of life ! <end>
<start> But I hear only slow death preached and patience with all that is earthly Alas ! <end>
<start> ye preach patience with what is earthly ? <end>
<start> What is earthly hath too much patience with you , ye reviews ! <end>
<start> Too early died that Hebrew whom the preachers of slow death revere : and his dying too early hath been fatal for many since . <end>
<start> When Jesus the Hebrew knew only the tears and melancholy of the Hebrew , together with the hatred of the good and just , then a longing for death surprised him . <end>
<start> OF FREE DEATH ii Would that he had remained in the desert and far away from the good and just ! <end>
<start> Perhaps he would have learnt how to live and to love the earth and how to laugh besides ! <end>
<start> Believe me , my brethren ! <end>
<start> He died too early he himself would have revoked his doctrine , had he reached mine age ! <end>
<start> Noble enough to revoke he was ! <end>
<start> But he was still unripe . <end>
<start> unlikely the youth lovett , and unlikely also he hate man and earth . <end>
<start> Fettered and heavy are still his mind and the wings of his spirit . <end>
<start> But in a man there is more of child than in a youth , and less of melancholy : he better how to manage death and life . <end>
<start> Free for death and free in death , a holy Nay sayer , when there is no longer time to say yea : thus he how to manage death and life . <end>
<start> That your dying may not be a blasphemy of man and earth , my friends , that is what I ask from the honey of your soul . <end>
<start> In your dying your spirit and your virtue shall glow on , like the evening red round the earth : or else your dying hath not succeeded well . <end>
<start> Thus I would die myself , that ye friends for my sake may love the earth more than before and I would become dust again , in order to have rest in earth which gave me birth . <end>
<start> Of a truth , Zarathustra had a goal , he threw his ball : now , friends , be the heirs of my goal , I throw the golden ball unto you . <end>
<start> Best of all , my friends , I like to see you throw the golden ball ! <end>
<start> And thus I wait for a little while on earth : excuse me ! <end>
<start> Zarathustra having taken leave of the town unto which his heart was attached and whose name is : the Cow of Many Colours many followed him who called themselves his disciples , and accompanied him . <end>
<start> Having arrived at four crossways , Zarathustra told them that now he wished to go alone for he had a liking for going alone . <end>
<start> But his disciples gave him at parting a stick on the golden handle of which a serpent curled round a sun . <end>
<start> Zarathustra , pleased with the stick and supporting himself with it , spake thus unto his disciples : Tell me : how came gold to be valued highest ? <end>
<start> Because it is uncommon and of little use and shining and chaste in its splendour it ever spender itself . <end>
<start> Only as an image of the highest virtue gold came to be valued highest . <end>
<start> godlike shine the glance of him who giveth . <end>
<start> The glitter of gold maketh peace between moon and sun . <end>
<start> Uncommon is the highest virtue , and of little use shining it is and chaste in its splendour : a giving virtue is the highest virtue . <end>
<start> Verily , I believe I have found you out , my disciples : ye seek like me after giving virtue . <end>
<start> What could ye have in common with cats and wolves ? <end>
<start> Your thirst is to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves : hence it is that ye thirst to heap all riches into your soul . <end>
<start> Unsatisfied your soul seemeth after treasures and trinkets because your virtue is ever unsatisfied in willing to give away . <end>
<start> Ye compel all things to come unto you and into you , in order that they may flow back from your well as gifts of your love . <end>
<start> Verily , such a giving love must become a robber as regarded all values but I call that selfishness healthy and holy . <end>
<start> There is another selfishness , a very poor one , a starving one which ever seemeth to steal , the selfishness of the sickly , sickly selfishness . <end>
<start> With a thief s eye it looked at all that glittered with the craving of hunger it measures him who hath plenty to eat and it ever stealth round the table of givers . <end>
<start> Disease speaker in that craving , and invisible degeneration of a sick body speaker the craving of that selfishness . <end>
<start> Tell me , my brethren : what regard we as the bad and the worst thing ? <end>
<start> Is it not degeneration f And we always suspect degeneration wherever the giving soul is lacking . <end>
<start> Upwards goethe our way , from species to . <end>
<start> But a horror for us is the degenerating mind which saith : All for myself ! <end>
<start> Upwards lieth our mind : it is an image of our body , an image of an exaltation . <end>
<start> The names of virtues are images of such exaltation . <end>
<start> Thus the body goethe through history , growing and fighting . <end>
<start> And the spirit what is it unto the body ? <end>
<start> The herald , companion and echo of its fights and victories . <end>
<start> All names of good and evil are images : they speak not out , they only beckon . <end>
<start> A fool he who seemeth knowledge from them ! <end>
<start> My brethren , give heed unto each hour , in which your spirit wished to speak in images : there is the origin of your virtue . <end>
<start> There your body is exalted and risen with its delight it ravished the spirit so that it become creative and valuing and loving and benefitting all things . <end>
<start> When your heart overflowed , broad and full like a stream , a blessing and a danger for those dwelling nigh : there is the origin of your virtue . <end>
<start> your will seemeth to command all things , as the will of a loving one : there is the origin of your virtue . <end>
<start> When ye despise what is agreeable and a soft bed , and know not how to make your bed far enough from the effeminate : there is the origin of your virtue . <end>
<start> When ye will one will , and that end of all trouble is called necessity by you : there is the origin of your virtue . <end>
<start> Verily , a new good and evil is your virtue verily , a new deep rushing , and the voice of a new well ! <end>
<start> It is power , that new virtue one dominating thought it is , and round it a cunning soul : a golden sun , and round it the serpent of knowledge . <end>
<start> Here Zarathustra was silent a while looking with love upon his disciples . <end>
<start> Then he continued to speak thus with a changed voice . <end>
<start> Remain faithful unto earth , my brethren , with the power of your virtue ! <end>
<start> Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the significance of earth ! <end>
<start> Thus I beg and conjure you . <end>
<start> Let it not fly away from what is earthly and beat against eternal walls with its wings ! <end>
<start> Alas , so much virtue hath ever gone astray in flying ! <end>
<start> Like me lead back unto earth the virtue which hath gone astray yea , back unto body and life : that it may give its significance unto earth , a human significance . <end>
<start> Spirit and virtue also have hitherto gone astray and mistaken their goals in a hundred ways . <end>
<start> Alas , in our body now all these illusions and mistakes still live . <end>
<start> Body and will they have become there . <end>
<start> Spirit and virtue also have lost themselves in seeking and erring hitherto . <end>
<start> Yea , man hath been only an attempt . <end>
<start> Alas , much ignorance and error have become body in us ! <end>
<start> Not only the reason of millenniums but also their madness breath out in us . <end>
<start> Dangerous it is to be an heir . <end>
<start> Yet we fight step by step with the giant of chance over all humanity hitherto not sense , the lack of sense , hath ruled . <end>
<start> Let your spirit and your virtue serve the significance of earth , my brethren and let the value of all things be fixed anew by yourselves ! <end>
<start> Therefore ye shall be fighters ! <end>
<start> Therefore ye shall be creators ! <end>
<start> Knowingly the body purified itself attempting with knowledge it exalted itself for him who perceived all instincts are proclaimed holy the soul of him who is exalted warmth merry . <end>
<start> Physician , heal thyself so thou nearest also thy patient . <end>
<start> Let that be his best health , that he may see with his own eyes him who hath made himself whole . <end>
<start> A thousand paths there are which have never yet been walked , a thousand health and hidden islands of life . <end>
<start> exhausted and undiscovered ever are man and the human earth . <end>
<start> Awake and listen , ye lonely ones ! <end>
<start> From the future winds are coming with a gentle beating of wings , and there cometh a good message for fine ears . <end>
<start> Ye lonely ones of to day , ye who stand apart , ye shall one day be a people : from you who have chosen yourselves , a chosen people shall arise : and from it beyond man . <end>
<start> Verily , a place of healing shall earth become ! <end>
<start> And already a new odour lieth round it , an odour which bridget salvation and a new hope . <end>
<start> Zarathustra having spoken these words was silent like one who hath not yet uttered his last word a long while he doubtfully balanced the stick in his hand . <end>
<start> At last he spake thus , his voice having again changed : Alone I now go , my disciples ! <end>
<start> Ye go also , and alone . <end>
<start> I would have it so . <end>
<start> Verily , I counsel you : depart from me and defend yourselves from Zarathustra ! <end>
<start> And better still : be ashamed of him . <end>
<start> Perhaps he hath deceived you . <end>
<start> OF GIVING VIRTUE ion The man of perception must not only be able to love his enemies , but also to hate his friends . <end>
<start> One ill one s teacher by always remaining only his scholar . <end>
<start> Why will ye not pluck at my wreath ? <end>
<start> Ye revere me but how if your reverence one day fallen down ? <end>
<start> Beware of being crushed to death by a statue ! <end>
<start> Ye say ye believe in Zarathustra ? <end>
<start> But what is Zarathustra worth ? <end>
<start> Ye are my faithful ones : but what are all faithful ones worth ! <end>
<start> When ye had not yet sought yourselves ye found me . <end>
<start> Thus do all faithful ones hence all belief is worth so little . <end>
<start> Now I ask you to lose me and find yourselves not until all of you have disowned me , shall I return unto you . <end>
<start> Verily , with other eyes , my brethren , I shall then seek my lost ones with another love I shall then love you . <end>
<start> And one day ye shall have become friends of mine and children of one hope : then I shall be with you for a third time , in order to celebrate with you the great noon . <end>
<start> And the great noon is when man standish in the middle of his course between animal and beyond man , and glorified his way unto the evening as his highest hope for it is the way unto a new morning . <end>
<start> ii THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA , I Then he who perished will bless himself as one who goethe beyond and his sun of knowledge will stand at noon . <end>
<start> Dead are all Gods : now we will that beyond man live . <end>
<start> Let this be one day your last will at the great noon ! <end>
<start> not until all of you have disowned me shall I return unto you . <end>
<start> Verily , with other eyes , my brethren , I shall then seek my lost ones with another love I shall then love you . <end>
<start> Zarathustra , I Of Giving VirtueTHE CHILD WITH THE LOOKING GLASS After this Zarathustra went back into the mountains and the solitude of his cave and withdrew from men , waiting like a sower who hath thrown out his seed . <end>
<start> But his soul was filled with impatience and longing for those he loved for he had still many gifts for them . <end>
<start> For this is the hardest : to shut one s open hand because of love , and as a giver to preserve one s modesty . <end>
<start> Thus months and years passed away with the lonely one , but his wisdom grew , and its abundance caused him pain . <end>
<start> But one morning he awoke before dawn , meditated long on his couch , and at last spake unto his heart : Why then was I terrified in my dream so that I awoke ? <end>
<start> Did not a child come unto me carrying a looking glass ? <end>
<start> O Zarathustra the child said unto me look at thyself in the looking glass ! <end>
<start> But when I looked into the looking glass I cried aloud , and my heart was shaken . <end>
<start> For in it I did not see myself , I saw a devil s grimace and scornful laughter . <end>
<start> Verily , only too well I understand the sign and warning of this dream my teaching is in danger : tares usurp the name of wheat . <end>
<start> Mine enemies have grown strong and have distorted the face of my teaching , so that my dearest friends must be ashamed of the gifts I gave them . <end>
<start> My friends are lost the hour hath come for me to seek my lost ones . <end>
<start> With these words Zarathustra started up , but not like one terrified seeking for air , on the contrary , like a prophet and poet visited by the spirit . <end>
<start> With astonishment his eagle and his serpent gazed upon him for a happiness to come lay on his countenance like the day blush . <end>
<start> What hath happened unto me , mine animals ? <end>
<start> said Zarathustra . <end>
<start> Am I not changed ! <end>
<start> Did not bliss come unto me like a storming ? <end>
<start> Foolish is my happiness , and foolish things it will say : too young it is : have patience with it ! <end>
<start> Wounded I am by my happiness . <end>
<start> All sufferers shall be my physicians ! <end>
<start> Again I am allowed to descend unto my friends as well as unto mine enemies ! <end>
<start> Again Zarathustra is allowed to speak and give and do his kindest unto his dear friends . <end>
<start> Mine impatient love flowers over in streams , downwards towards east and west . <end>
<start> Out of silent mountains and thunderstorms of pain my soul rushed into the valleys . <end>
<start> Too long have I yearned and looked into the distance too long hath solitude possessed me : thus I have got to silence . <end>
<start> Mouth I have become all over , and the brawling of a brook rushing from high rocks : I will hurl my speech into the valleys . <end>
<start> Let the stream of my love rush into what is pathless ! <end>
<start> How should a stream not at last find its way into the ocean ! <end>
<start> It is true , there is a lake within me , hermit like , self contented but the stream of my love heareth it along into the ocean ! <end>
<start> New paths I tread , a new speech cometh unto me like all creators I have grown weary of old tongues . <end>
<start> My mind wished no more to walk on worn out soles . <end>
<start> Too slowly all speech kenneth for me . <end>
<start> Into thy chariot , O storm , I leap . <end>
<start> And even thee I will scourge with my salinity . <end>
<start> Like a cry and a shouting of triumph I shall rush over wide seas until I find the blissful islands where my friends dwell . <end>
<start> And mine enemies among them ! <end>
<start> How I now love everyone unto whom I may speak ! <end>
<start> Even mine enemies are part of my bliss . <end>
<start> And when I mount my wildest horse my spear always helped me best to get on its back it is the ever ready servant of my foot . <end>
<start> The spear which I throw at mine enemies ! <end>
<start> How grateful am I unto mine enemies that at last I may throw it ! <end>
<start> Too heavily charged was my cloud : between the laughter of lightnings I will throw hail showers into the depths . <end>
<start> Powerfully my breast will heave , powerfully it will blow its over the mountains : thus it will relieve itself . <end>
<start> Verily , like a storm my happiness and my freedom come . <end>
<start> But mine enemies shall believe that the evil one rage over their heads . <end>
<start> Yea , ye also will be terrified by my wild wisdom , my friends , and perhaps ye will flee away along with mine enemies . <end>
<start> Oh ! <end>
<start> that I were able to tempt you back with a herdsman s flute ! <end>
<start> Oh ! <end>
<start> that the lioness of my wisdom would learn how to growl lovingly ! <end>
<start> How many things we have already learnt together . <end>
<start> My wild wisdom became pregnant on lonely mountains upon rugged stones she bore her young , her youngest . <end>
<start> Now she kenneth strangely through the hard desert and seemeth , and ever seemeth for soft grass , mine old wild wisdom . <end>
<start> She would fain bed her dearest on the soft grass of your hearts , on your love , my friends ! <end>
<start> The figs fall from the trees , they are good and sweet and while falling their red skin . <end>
<start> A north wind I am unto ripe figs . <end>
<start> Thus , my friends , those precepts fall unto your share like figs : now drink their juice and their sweet meat ! <end>
<start> Autumn it is round about and clear sky and afternoon . <end>
<start> Behold what plenty is around us ! <end>
<start> And it is beautiful to gaze on remote seas from the midst of plenty . <end>
<start> Once folk said God when they gazed on remote seas , now I have taught you to say : Beyond man . <end>
<start> God is a supposition but I would have your supposing reach no further than your creative will . <end>
<start> Could ye create a God ? <end>
<start> Then be silent concerning all Gods ! <end>
<start> But ye could very well create . <end>
<start> could create yourselves into fathers and fore fathers of beyond ran : and let this be your best creating ! <end>
<start> God is a supposition but I would have your supposing limited by . <end>
<start> Could ye conceive a God ? <end>
<start> But let this be for you will unto truth , that all be turned into something conceivable , visible , tangible for men ! <end>
<start> Ye should mentally follow your own senses unto their ends . <end>
<start> And what ye called world hath still to be created by you : it shall become your reason , your image , your will , your love itself ! <end>
<start> And , verily , it would be for your bliss , ye perceiving ones ! <end>
<start> How could ye bear life without that hope , ye perceiving ones ? <end>
<start> Ye could neither have been born into an inconceivable , nor into an unreasonable world . <end>
<start> But let me reveal unto you my heart entirely , my friends . <end>
<start> If there were Gods , how could I bear to be no God ! <end>
<start> Consequently there are no Gods . <end>
<start> True , I have drawn that conclusion , but now it drawer me . <end>
<start> God is a supposition , but who could drink all the pain of that supposition without dying ? <end>
<start> Is the creator to be bereaved of his belief , and the eagle of his flight into eagle distances ? <end>
<start> God is a thought which beneath all that is straight , and turned round whatever standish still . <end>
<start> How ? <end>
<start> Should time have disappeared , and all that is perishable be a mere lie ? <end>
<start> To think this is a whirling and giddiness for human bones and a vomiting for the stomach . <end>
<start> The giddy sickness I call it to imagine such things . <end>
<start> Evil I call it and hostile unto human beings , all that teaching of the one thing , the full , the unmoved , the satisfied , the imperishable ! <end>
<start> All that is imperishable is only a simile ! <end>
<start> And the poets lie too much . <end>
<start> But for a simile the best images shall speak of time and becoming a praise they shall be and a justification of all ! <end>
<start> Creating that is the great salvation from suffering and an alleviation of life . <end>
<start> But for the existence of the creator pain and much transformation are necessary . <end>
<start> Yea , much bitter death must be in your life , ye creators ! <end>
<start> Thus ye are advocates and justifies of all . <end>
<start> In order to be the child that is newly born , the creator must also be the child bearing woman and the pain of the child bearing woman . <end>
<start> Verily , I have gone my way through an hundred souls and through an hundred cradles and birth throes . <end>
<start> Many times have I taken leave I know the heartbreaking last hours . <end>
<start> But thus willett my creative will my doom . <end>
<start> Or to put it more candidly : such a doom is just willed by my will . <end>
<start> prison but my willing always approaches me as my liberator and bringer of joy . <end>
<start> Willing delivered : that is the true doctrine of will and freedom thus ye are taught by Zarathustra . <end>
<start> No longer willing , and no longer valuing , and no longer creating ! <end>
<start> Oh , that that great weariness were for ever far from me ! <end>
<start> Even in perception I feel only the lust of my will to procreate and grow and if there be innocence in my perception , it is because there is in it will unto procreation . <end>
<start> This will enticed me away from God and Gods for what could be created , if there were Gods ! <end>
<start> But mine ardent will to create impelled me unto man ever anew . <end>
<start> Thus the hammer is impelled unto the stone . <end>
<start> Alas , ye men , in the stone there sleeper for me an image , the image of all mine images ! <end>
<start> Alas , that it should have to sleep in the hardest and ugliest stone ! <end>
<start> Now my hammer rage cruelly against its prison . <end>
<start> Pieces fly off from the stone : what doth it concern me ? <end>
<start> I shall finish it . <end>
<start> For a shadow came unto me the smallest and lightest of all things once came unto me ! <end>
<start> The beauty of beyond man came unto me as a shadow . <end>
<start> Alas , my brethren ! <end>
<start> What do Gods concern me ! <end>
<start> My friends , a mocking speech hath come unto your friend : Behold Zarathustra ! <end>
<start> Doth he not walk among us as among animals ? <end>
<start> But it is better said thus : The perceiving one walked among men as being animals . <end>
<start> Man himself is called by the perceiving one : the animal with red cheeks . <end>
<start> How did he get them ? <end>
<start> Was it not because he had occasion so often to be ashamed ? <end>
<start> my friends ! <end>
<start> Thus speaker the perceiving one : Shame , shame , shame , that is the history of man ! <end>
<start> That is why the noble one maketh it his law never to make anybody ashamed . <end>
<start> He maketh it his law to be ashamed in presence of all that suffered . <end>
<start> Verily , I like them not , the merciful who are blessed in their mercy . <end>
<start> Too much they are lacking in the sense of shame . <end>
<start> If I must be pitiful , I do not wish to be called so and if I am so , I like to be so at a distance . <end>
<start> also like to veil my head and flee before being recognised and thus I ask you to do , my friends ! <end>
<start> Would that my fate would always lead across my path such as are free from sorrow like you , and such as those with whom I may share hope and meal and honey . <end>
<start> Verily , now and then I did something for sufferers , but I always seemed unto myself to do something better when I learned how to enjoy myself better . <end>
<start> Since man came into existence he hath had too little joy . <end>
<start> That alone , my brethren , is our original sin ! <end>
<start> And when we learn how to have more joy we best get to cause pain and to invent pain unto others . <end>
<start> Therefore I wash my hand which helped the sufferer therefore I even wipe my soul . <end>
<start> For on account of the sufferer s shame I was ashamed , when seeing him suffer and when I helped him , I strongly offended his pride . <end>
<start> Great obligations do not make grateful but vengeful and when a small benefit is not forgotten , it turned into a gnawing worm . <end>
<start> Be shy of accepting ! <end>
<start> Distinguish by accepting ! <end>
<start> thus I counsel those who have nothing to give away . <end>
<start> But I am a giver : willingly I give , as a friend unto friends . <end>
<start> But strangers and paupers may themselves pluck the fruit from my tree : thus it cause less shame . <end>
<start> Beggars should be abolished utterly ! <end>
<start> Verily , we are angry when giving them anything and are angry when not giving . <end>
<start> And likewise the sinners and bad consciences ! <end>
<start> Believe me , my friends : remorse of conscience teachers to bite . <end>
<start> But the worst are petty thoughts . <end>
<start> Verily , it is still better to act wickedly than to think prettily . <end>
<start> True ye say : The pleasure derived from petty wickedness safety us many a great wicked deed . <end>
<start> But here folk should not try to save . <end>
<start> Like an ulcer is an evil deed : it itched and scratched and breath forth , it speaker honestly . <end>
<start> Behold , I am disease saith the evil deed : that is its honesty . <end>
<start> But the petty thought resemble a fungus : it creepers and cowered and wished to be nowhere until the whole body is rotten and withered with small fungi . <end>
<start> Unto him who is possessed by the devil I say this word into his ear : It is better for thee to bring up thy devil . <end>
<start> Even for thee there is a way unto greatness ! <end>
<start> Alas , my brethren ! <end>
<start> Of everybody one knower a little too much . <end>
<start> And many a one become transparent for us but for that reason we are by no means able to penetrate him . <end>
<start> It is difficult to live with men , because silence is so difficult . <end>
<start> And we are most unjust not unto him who is contrary to our taste , but unto him who doth not concern us in any way . <end>
<start> But if thou hast a suffering friend , be a couch for his suffering , but a hard bed , as it were , a field bed : thus thou wilt be of most use for him . <end>
<start> And if a friend doth wrong unto thee , say : I forgive thee what thou didst unto me , but that thou didst so unto thyself , how could I forgive that ? <end>
<start> Thus speaker all great love : it even overcome forgiveness and pity . <end>
<start> One must keep fast one s heart . <end>
<start> For if one letter it go , how soon the head kenneth away ! <end>
<start> Alas ! <end>
<start> where in the world have greater follies hap opened than with the pitiful ? <end>
<start> And what in the world hath done more harm than the follies of the pitiful ? <end>
<start> Woe unto all loving ones who do not possess an elevation which is above their pity ! <end>
<start> Thus the devil once said unto me : Even God hath his own hell : that is his love unto men . <end>
<start> And recently I heard the word said : God is dead he hath died of his pity for men . <end>
<start> Beware of pity : a heavy cloud will one day come from it for men . <end>
<start> Verily , I understand about ! <end>
<start> But remember this word also : All great love is lifted above all its pity , for it seemeth to create what it lovett ! <end>
<start> Myself I sacrifice unto my love , and my neighbour as myself , thus kenneth the speech of all creators . <end>
<start> Thus spake Zarathustra . <end>
<start> OF PRIESTS One day Zarathustra made a sign unto his disciples and spake unto them these words : Here are priests . <end>
<start> And though they are mine enemies , pass them quietly and with sleeping sword ! <end>
<start> Among them also there are heroes many of them have suffered too much . <end>
<start> Hence they try to make others suffer . <end>
<start> Evil friends they are : nothing is more vengeful than their submissiveness . <end>
<start> And easily he defile himself who touched them . <end>
<start> But my blood is kindred with theirs I would have my blood honoured even in theirs . <end>
<start> And when they had passed , Zarathustra was attacked by pain . <end>
<start> And when he had fought with his pain a little while , he thus began to speak : I am sorry for these priests . <end>
<start> They are contrary unto my taste , but that is a small matter unto me since I am dwelling among men . <end>
<start> But I suffer and have suffered with them : prisoners they are for me , and branded ones . <end>
<start> He whom they call Saviour put them into fetters : Into the fetters of false values and illusory words ! <end>
<start> Oh , that some one would save them from their Saviour ! <end>
<start> Once when the sea tossed them to and fro they believed they had landed on an island but , behold , it was a slumbering monster ! <end>
<start> False values and illusory words : these are the worst monsters for mortals : in them doom and waited long . <end>
<start> But at last it cometh and maketh and earth and devoured whatever made its tabernacle upon it Oh , look at the tabernacles made by these priests ! <end>
<start> Churches they call their sweetly smelling dens . <end>
<start> Oh , that falsified light , that heavy air ! <end>
<start> This place where the soul is not allowed to fly upwards unto its height ! <end>
<start> But thus its faith commander ! <end>
<start> On your knees up the stairs , ye sinners ! <end>
<start> Verily , I would rather see the shameless than the sprained eyes of their shame and devotion ! <end>
<start> Who created for himself such dens and stairs of penitence ? <end>
<start> Was it not such as sought to hide themselves and were ashamed of the clear sky ? <end>
<start> And not until the clear sky shall again look through broken ceilings and down on grass and red poppy growing by broken walls , shall I again turn my heart unto the places of this God . <end>
<start> They called God what was opposite and painful unto them : and , verily , there was much of the heroic in their worship ! <end>
<start> And they did not know how to love their God otherwise than by fixing man unto the cross . <end>
<start> As corpses they meant to live , in black they draped their corpse : even in their words I smell the evil seasoning of the dead house . <end>
<start> And he who giveth nigh unto them , giveth nigh unto the black ponds from which the toad singer its song in sweet melancholy . <end>
<start> In order that I might learn to believe in their saviour they ought to sing better songs , and his disciples ought to look saved like . <end>
<start> I would fain see them naked : for beauty alone should preach penitence . <end>
<start> But who in the world is persuaded by that disguised affliction ? <end>
<start> Verily , even their saviours have not come from freedom and the seventh heaven of freedom ! <end>
<start> Verily , they themselves have never walked on the carpets of knowledge ! <end>
<start> The mind of these saviours consisted of voids , but into every void they had put their illusion , their stopgap whom they called God . <end>
<start> In their pity their mind was drowned , and when they swelled , and swelled over from pity , at the surface there always swam a great folly . <end>
<start> Eagerly and with much crying they drove their flock over their wooden bridge , as if there were only a single bridge into the future ! <end>
<start> Verily , those herdsmen also were of the sheep ! <end>
<start> Petty intellects and comprehensive souls these herdsmen had : but , my brethren , what small territories hitherto have been even the most comprehensive souls ! <end>
<start> Signs of blood have been written by them on the way they went , and it was taught by their folly that truth is proved by blood . <end>
<start> But blood is the worst of all witnesses for truth blood even poisoned the purest teaching and turned it into delusion and hatred of hearts . <end>
<start> And when a man goethe through fire for his teaching what is proved thereby ? <end>
<start> Verily , it is more when one s own teaching springett from one s own burning . <end>
<start> A sultry heart and a cool head , where these happen to meet , the blustered arise , the saviour . <end>
<start> Verily , there have been much greater ones and more highly born ones than those whom folk call saviours , those ravishing blustered . <end>
<start> And ye , my brethren , if ye ever wish to find the way unto freedom , ye must be saved by much greater ones than any saviours have been . <end>
<start> Never yet beyond man existed . <end>
<start> I have seen them both naked , the greatest and the smallest man . <end>
<start> Much too like are they still unto each other . <end>
<start> Verily , even the greatest one I found to be much too human ! <end>
<start> With thunder and heavenly fire works one hath to speak unto languid and sleeping senses . <end>
<start> But the voice of beauty speaker gently it stealth only into the souls . <end>
<start> To day my shield trembled and laughed gently : that is the holy laughter and trembling of beauty . <end>
<start> Over you , ye virtuous , my beauty laughed to day . <end>
<start> And thus came its voice unto me : They wish to be paid in addition ! <end>
<start> Ye wish to be paid in addition , ye virtuous ! <end>
<start> Ye wish reward for virtue , heaven for earths , and eternity for your to day ? <end>
<start> And now ye are angry at my teaching that there is no rewarded and pay master . <end>
<start> Nay , I do not even teach that virtue is its own reward . <end>
<start> Alas ! <end>
<start> That is my trouble : reward and punishment have been deceitful put into the foundation of things and now even into the foundation of your souls , ye virtuous ! <end>
<start> But like a boar s snout my word shall harrow the foundation of your souls . <end>
<start> I would have you call me a plough . <end>
<start> All the secrets of your foundation shall be brought unto light and when ye will lie in the sun narrowed and crushed , your lie will be separated from your truth . <end>
<start> For this is your truth : ye are too cleanly for the filth of the words : revenge , punishment , reward , retaliation . <end>
<start> Ye love your virtue as the mother doth her child but did anybody ever hear of a mother wishing to be paid for her love ? <end>
<start> It is your dearest self , your virtue . <end>
<start> The thirst of the ring is within you . <end>
<start> To reach itself again , for that purpose every ring struggle and turned . <end>
<start> And every work of your virtue resemble a star extinguished . <end>
<start> Its light is still on the way and travelled on . <end>
<start> When will it have ceased to be on the way ? <end>
<start> Thus the light of your virtue is still on the way , even when the work hath been done . <end>
<start> Be it forgotten or dead , its beam of light still giveth and travelled . <end>
<start> That your virtue is your self , and not anything strange , a skin , a mantle : that is the truth from the foundation of your soul , ye virtuous ! <end>
<start> But to be sure there are men who call the agony under the whip virtue and ye have listened too much unto their crying ! <end>
<start> And there are others who call the putrefaction of their vices virtue and when their hatred and their jealousy for once stretch their limbs , their justice awakened and rubbish its sleepy eyes . <end>
<start> And there are others who are drawn downwards : they are drawn by their devils . <end>
<start> But the deeper they sink the more ardently gleamed their eye and the desire for their God . <end>
<start> Alas , their crying also hath reached your ears , ye virtuous : What I am not , that , that is for me God and virtue ! <end>
<start> And there are others who walk about heavily and creaking like waggons carrying stones downhill . <end>
<start> They talk much of dignity and virtue , their skid they call virtue ! <end>
<start> And there are others who are wound up like every day watches they go on ticking and wish that ticking to be called virtue . <end>
<start> Verily , these are mine entertainment . <end>
<start> Wherever I find such watches I shall wind them up with my mocking and they shall even click at that . <end>
<start> And others are proud of their handful of justice , and for its sake commit outrages on ah things , so that the world is drowned with their injustice . <end>
<start> Alas ! <end>
<start> How badly the word virtue cometh from their mouth ! <end>
<start> And when they say : I am just , it sounded almost like : I am just revenged ! <end>
<start> of their enemies they only extol themselves in order to debase others . <end>
<start> And again there are others who sit in their mudbank and thus speak out of the bulrushes : Virtue that meant to sit still in the mud bath . <end>
<start> We bite nobody and go out of the way of him who seemeth to bite and in all things we have the opinion we are given . <end>
<start> And again there are such as love gestures and think virtue is a kind of gesture . <end>
<start> Their knees always adore , and their hands are a praise of virtue , but their heart knower nothing of it . <end>
<start> And again there are such as deem it virtue to say : Virtue is necessary but in reality they only believe police to be necessary . <end>
<start> And many a one who cannon see what is sublime in men , called it virtue to see too well what is base in them : thus he called his evil eye virtue . <end>
<start> And some wish to be deified and lifted up , and call it virtue and others wish to be cast down and call it virtue also . <end>
<start> And in this way almost all believe they share in virtue . <end>
<start> At any rate everybody would have himself to be an expert as to good and evil . <end>
<start> Zarathustra hath not come to say unto all these liars and fools : What know ye of virtue ! <end>
<start> What could ye know of virtue ! <end>
<start> But that ye , my friends , may become weary of the old words which ye have learnt from fools and liars . <end>
<start> Weary of the words reward , retaliation , punishment , revenge in justice Weary of saying : That an action is good , springett from its being unselfish . <end>
<start> Alas , my friends ! <end>
<start> That your self be in your action as a mother is in the child , that shall be for me your word of virtue ! <end>
<start> Verily , I have taken from you perhaps an hundred words and the dearest play things of your virtue and now ye are angry with me as children are . <end>
<start> They played on the seashore , then came a wave and swept all their toys away into the depth : now they cry . <end>
<start> But the same wave shall bring them new playthings and spread before them new coloured shells . <end>
<start> Thus they will be comforted and like them ye also , my friends , shall have your comforts and new coloured shells ! <end>
<start> Life is a well of lust but wherever the rabble drink also , all wells are poisoned . <end>
<start> I am fond of all things cleanly I like not to see the grinning mouths and the thirst of the unclean . <end>
<start> They have cast their eye down into the well now their repugnant smile shine up out of the well . <end>
<start> The holy water hath been poisoned by their concupiscence and when calling their foul dreams lust they have poisoned words as well . <end>
<start> Angry warmth the flame when they lay their damp hearts nigh the fire the spirit itself bubble and smoke wherever the rabble approach the fire . <end>
<start> Sweetish and much too mellow warmth the fruit in their hand shaky and withered at the top warmth the fruit tree from their look . <end>
<start> And many a one who turned away from life only turned away from the rabble he cared not to share with them well and fire and fruit And many a one who went into the desert and suffered from thirst with the camels , merely cared not to sit round the cistern with dirty camel drivers . <end>
<start> And many a one who came along like a destroyer and a hail storm unto all corn fields , merely intended to put his foot into the jaws of the rabble and thus stuff their throat . <end>
<start> And this was not the bit which choked me most : to know that life itself required hostility and death and crosses of torture But once I asked and was almost suffocated by my question : What ? <end>
<start> doth life also require rabble ? <end>
<start> Are poisoned wells required , and stinking fires , and foul dreams , and mites in the bread of life ? <end>
<start> Not my hatred but my loathing gnawed hungrily at my life ! <end>
<start> Alas , I frequently wearied of the spirit when I found the rabble also full of spirit ! <end>
<start> And I turned my back upon the rulers , when I saw what is now called ruling : to schaffer and barter about power with the rabble ! <end>
<start> Among nations with foreign tongues I lived with closed ears , in order that the tongue of their chattering might remain unknown unto me , and their bartering about power . <end>
<start> u yesterday and to day . <end>
<start> Verily , after writing rabble J J J J Like a cripple who became deaf and blind and dumb , thus I lived long in order not to live with the rabble of power , writing , and lust . <end>
<start> With difficulty my mind went up stairs , and can piously alms of lust were its refreshments for the blind man , life crept leaning on a stick . <end>
<start> What happened unto me ? <end>
<start> How did I free myself from loathing ? <end>
<start> How became mine eye younger ? <end>
<start> How did I reach in flying the height where no longer the rabble sit at the well ? <end>
<start> Did my very loathing give me wings and powers divining wells ? <end>
<start> Verily , I had to fly unto the very highest to rediscover the well of lust ! <end>
<start> Oh , I found it , my brethren ! <end>
<start> How on the very height the well of lust flowers for me ! <end>
<start> And there is a life , in the drinking of which no rabble share ! <end>
<start> Almost too violently for me thou lowest , well of lust ! <end>
<start> And frequently thou emptiest the cup again by trying to fill it ! <end>
<start> And yet I must learn to approach thee more modestly . <end>
<start> Much too violently my heart flowers towards thee My heart on which my summer burnett , the short , hot , melancholy , all too blessed summer ! <end>
<start> How doth my summer heart long for thy coolness ! <end>
<start> Past is the hesitating trouble of my spring ! <end>
<start> Past is the wickedness of my flakes of snow in June ! <end>
<start> Wholly I became summer and a summer noon ! <end>
<start> A summer on the very height with cold wells and blessed stillness ! <end>
<start> Oh come , my friends , that the stillness may become still more blessed ! <end>
<start> and too steeply we here stay for all the impure and their thirst . <end>
<start> Just cast your pure eyes into the well of my lust , ye friends ! <end>
<start> How could it become muddy therefrom ! <end>
<start> Laughing with its purity it shall receive you . <end>
<start> On the tree of the future we build our nest . <end>
<start> Eagles are to bring food with their beaks unto us lonely ones ! <end>
<start> Verily , no food in the eating of which impure ones would be allowed to share ! <end>
<start> They would fancy they ate fire and burned their mouths with it . <end>
<start> Verily , here we have no homes ready for impure ones . <end>
<start> Unto their bodies our happiness would mean a cave of ice , and unto their minds as well ! <end>
<start> And like strong winds we will live above them , companions of eagles , companions of the snow , companions of the sun thus live strong winds . <end>
<start> And like a wind I shall one day blow amidst them and take away their breath with my spirit thus my future willett it . <end>
<start> Verily , a strong wind is Zarathustra for all low lands and his enemies and everything that and he counselled with such advice : Take care to spit against the wind ! <end>
<start> Behold , this is the cave of the tarantula ! <end>
<start> Wouldst thou see itself ? <end>
<start> Here hanged its net . <end>
<start> Touch it so as to make it tremble . <end>
<start> There the tarantula cometh willingly . <end>
<start> Welcome , tarantula ! <end>
<start> Black on thy back is thy triangle and mark besides , I know what is in thy soul . <end>
<start> Revenge is in thy soul : wherever thou bites , black canker warmth with revenge thy poison maketh the soul turn round . <end>
<start> Thus I speak unto you in a parable , ye who make the souls turn round , ye preachers of equality ! <end>
<start> For me ye are tarantula and underhand vengeful ones ! <end>
<start> But I shall bring unto the light your hiding places . <end>
<start> Therefore I laugh into your face my laughter of the height . <end>
<start> Therefore I tear at your net so that rage may tempt you out of your cave of lying and your revenge may jump forth from behind your word justice . <end>
<start> To save man from revenge , that is for me the bridge towards the highest hope , and a rainbow after long thunderstorms . <end>
<start> But the tarantulas would have it otherwise . <end>
<start> Call it very justice , to fill the world with the thunderstorms of our revenge , thus they speak unto each other . <end>
<start> Revenge will we take , and aspersions will we cast on all who are not like us this the pledge unto themselves . <end>
<start> And will unto equality that itself shall in the future become the name of virtue and we will raise our clamour against everything that hath power ! <end>
<start> Ye preachers of equality , the tyrant insanity of impotency thus cried out of yourselves for equality : Your most secret tyrant aspirations thus disguise themselves under words of virtue ! <end>
<start> Surly presumption , hidden envy , perhaps the presumption and envy of your fathers : as a flame and insanity of revenge they break forth from you . <end>
<start> What the father kept close is uttered by the son and frequently I found the son to be the revealed secret of the father . <end>
<start> They resemble the enthusiastic but it is not the heart that roused their enthusiasm , but revenge . <end>
<start> And when they grow sharp and cold , it is not spirit , but envy that maketh them sharp and cold . <end>
<start> Their jealousy even leader them into the paths of thinkers and it is the mark of their jealousy that they ever go too far , so that their weariness hath at last to lie down on the snow to sleep . <end>
<start> each of their praises is a sore and to be judges appeared unto them to be bliss . <end>
<start> But thus I counsel you , my friends : Mistrust all in whom the impulse to punish is powerful ! <end>
<start> They are folk of bad kin and descent . <end>
<start> Out of their countenances look the hang man and blood hound . <end>
<start> Mistrust all those who talk much of their justice ! <end>
<start> Verily , it is not honey merely that their souls lack . <end>
<start> And if they call themselves the good and just forget not that to be Pharisees they lack nothing but power ! <end>
<start> My friends , I like not to be confounded with and taken for a wrong one . <end>
<start> There are some that preach my doctrine of life but at the same time are preachers of equality and tarantula . <end>
<start> If they speak favourably of life although they sit in their cave , these poisonous spiders , and have turned away from life : it is because they wish to cause pain . <end>
<start> They intend to cause pain unto those who now have power for with them the sermon of death is most at home . <end>
<start> Were it otherwise the tarantula would teach otherwise . <end>
<start> Once it was just they who were the best of the world and the best burners of heretics . <end>
<start> I do not wish to be confounded with , and mistaken for these preachers of equality . <end>
<start> For within me justice saith : Men are not equal . <end>
<start> Neither shall they become so ! <end>
<start> For what would be my love for beyond man if I spake otherwise ? <end>
<start> On a thousand bridges and gang ways they shall throng towards the future , and ever more war and inequality shall be set up among them . <end>
<start> Thus my great love maketh me speak ! <end>
<start> Inventors of images and ghosts they shall become in their hostilities , and with their images and ghosts they shall fight against each other the supreme battle ! <end>
<start> Good and evil , rich and poor , high and low , and all the names of values : they shall be weapons and clashing signs that life always hath to surpass itself again ! <end>
<start> Upwards it strive to build itself with pillars and stairs , life itself : into far distances it longer to gaze and outwards after blessed beauties therefore it needed height ! <end>
<start> And because it needed height it needed stairs and contradiction between stairs and those rising beyond them ! <end>
<start> To rise strive life and to surpass itself in rising . <end>
<start> And now behold , my friends ! <end>
<start> Here where the cave of the tarantula is , the ruins of an old temple rise , do ye gaze there with enlightened eyes ! <end>
<start> Verily , he who here once made his thoughts tower upwards in stone , like the wisest one he knew the secret of all life ! <end>
<start> That even in beauty there is fight and inequality and war over power and superiority : he teachers it unto us in the clearest parable . <end>
<start> How divinely here vaults and arches break each other in a struggle ! <end>
<start> How with light and shadow they strive contrary unto each other , the divinely striving ones ! <end>
<start> Let our enemies also be thus secure and beautiful , my friends ! <end>
<start> Divinely we will strive contrary unto each other ! <end>
<start> Alas ! <end>
<start> There the tarantula bit me , mine old enemy ! <end>
<start> Divinely , securely , and beautifully it bit my finger ! <end>
<start> There must be punishment and justice thus it thinkers . <end>
<start> Not for nothing shall he sing here songs in honour of hostility ! <end>
<start> Yea , it hath taken its revenge ! <end>
<start> And alas , now it will with revenge even make my soul turn round ! <end>
<start> But that I may not turn round , my friends , tie me fast unto this pillar ! <end>
<start> I will rather be a style than a whirlpool of ! <end>
<start> Verily , no whirlwind or eddy wind is Zarathustra and if he be a dancer , he will never be a ! <end>
<start> Ye have saved the folk and the superstition of the folk , all ye famous wise men , and not truth ! <end>
<start> And for that very reason ye were revered . <end>
<start> And for the same reason your unbelief was endured because it was a joke and a round about way unto the folk . <end>
<start> Thus the lord allowed his slaves to bustle about and is amused with their over flowing spirits . <end>
<start> But what is hated by the folk as a wolf is by the dogs is the free spirit , the enemy of all fetters , the not adored , he who giveth in the woods . <end>
<start> To hunt him up from his hiding place that hath always been called by the folk : the sense for what is right : against him they still bait their hounds with the sharpest teeth . <end>
<start> For truth is there because the folk are there ! <end>
<start> Alas ! <end>
<start> Alas ! <end>
<start> for them who seek ! <end>
<start> Thus it hath sounded at all times . <end>
<start> Ye tried to help your people to feel themselves right in their reverence . <end>
<start> That was what ye called will unto truth , ye famous wise men ! <end>
<start> And for ever your heart said unto itself : From the folk I have sprung thence also sprang the voice of God . <end>
<start> Stiff necks and wisdom ye always had , like the asses , when ye were the folk s advocates . <end>
<start> And many a mighty one who wished to drive well with the folk , harnessed in front of his horses a little ass , a famous wise man . <end>
<start> And now I wish , ye famous wise men , ye would finally and entirely throw off the hide of the lion ! <end>
<start> The hide of the beast of prey , the many coloured , and the shaggy hair of the explorer , seeker , conqueror ! <end>
<start> Alas ! <end>
<start> in order to make me believe in your truthfulness , ye would require first to break your reversing will . <end>
<start> Truthful thus I call him who goethe into godless deserts and hath broken his reversing heart . <end>
<start> In yellow sand burnt by the sun , it is true , he leered thirstily at the islands full of wells where living things rest under dark trees . <end>
<start> But his thirst persuade him not to become like these comfortable ones for where oases are , there are idols also . <end>
<start> Hungry , violent , lonely , godless thus the lion s will willett itself . <end>
<start> Free from the happiness of slaves saved from Gods and adoration fearless and fear inspiring great and lonely this is the will of the truthful one . <end>
<start> In the desert at all times the truthful have lived , the free spirits , as the masters of the desert but in towns live the well fed , famous wise men , the . <end>
<start> Not that therefore I was angry with them but as serving ones they are regarded by me , and as harnessed ones , even if they glitter in golden harness . <end>
<start> For often they were good servants and worth their hire . <end>
<start> For thus speaker virtue : If thou must be a servant , seek him unto whom thy service will be of the most use ! <end>
<start> The spirit and virtue of thy master shall grow in that thou art his servant . <end>
<start> Thus thou thyself wilt grow with his spirit and his virtue ! <end>
<start> And , verily , ye famous wise men , ye servants of the folk ! <end>
<start> Ye yourselves have grown with the folk s spirit and virtue and the folk through you ! <end>
<start> I say so in your honour ! <end>
<start> But folk ye remain for me even in your virtues , folk with dim sighted eyes , folk that know not what spirit is ! <end>
<start> Spirit is that life which itself cutter into life . <end>
<start> By one s own pain one s own knowledge increase knew ye that before ? <end>
<start> And the happiness of the spirit is this : to be anointed and consecrated by tears as a sacrificial animal knew ye that before ? <end>
<start> And even the blindness of the blind and his seeking and fumbling shall bear witness as unto the power of the sun , into which he gazed knew ye that before ? <end>
<start> And the perceiver shall learn to build with mountains . <end>
<start> Little it is for the spirit to remove mountains knew ye that before ? <end>
<start> Ye only see the sparks of the spirit ye know not the anvil it is , nor the cruelty of its hammer ! <end>
<start> Verily , ye know not the pride of the spirit ! <end>
<start> Still less wo . <end>
<start> old ye endure the modesty of the spirit , if it once would utter it . <end>
<start> Neither have ye ever before been allowed to throw your spirit into a pit of snow . <end>
<start> Ye are not hot enough for that . <end>
<start> Thus ye know not , either , the ravishing of its coldness . <end>
<start> But in every respect ye make yourselves too familiar with the spirit and ye have frequently made out of wisdom an alms house and infirmary for bad poets . <end>
<start> Ye are not eagles . <end>
<start> Thus ye have never experienced the happiness in the terror of the spirit . <end>
<start> And he who is not a bird shall not dwell over bosses . <end>
<start> Ye are for me lukewarm but every deep perception flowers cold . <end>
<start> As cold as ice are the innermost wells of the spirit , a refreshment for hot hands and doers . <end>
<start> Decently there ye stand , and stiff , and with a stiff back , ye famous wise men ! <end>
<start> Ye are not driven by any strong wind or will . <end>
<start> Saw ye never a sail go over the sea , rounded and blown up and trembling with the violence of the wind ? <end>
<start> Like that sail , trembling with the violence of the spirit , my wisdom goethe over the sea my wild wisdom ! <end>
<start> But ye servants of the folk , ye famous wise men , how could ye go with me ! <end>
<start> Night it is : now talk louder all springing wells . <end>
<start> And my soul is a springing well . <end>
<start> Night it is : only now all songs of the loving awake . <end>
<start> And my soul is the song of a loving one . <end>
<start> Something never stilled , something never to be stilled is within me . <end>
<start> It longer to give forth sound . <end>
<start> A longing for love is within me , that itself speaker the language of love . <end>
<start> Light I am : would that I were night ! <end>
<start> But it is my loneliness , to be girded round by light . <end>
<start> Oh , that I were dark and like the night ! <end>
<start> How would I suck at the breasts of light ! <end>
<start> And I would bless even you , ye small , sparkling stars and glow worms on high , and be blessed by your gifts of light ! <end>
<start> But in mine own light I live , back into myself I drink the flames that break forth from me . <end>
<start> I know not the happiness of the receiver . <end>
<start> And often I dreamt that stealing was needs much sweeter than receiving . <end>
<start> It is my poverty that my hand never rested from giving it is mine envy that I see waiting eyes and the illuminated nights of longing . <end>
<start> Oh , blessedness of all givers ! <end>
<start> Oh , of my sun ! <end>
<start> Oh , longing for longing ! <end>
<start> Oh , famished voracity in the midst of satisfaction ! <end>
<start> They take things from me : but do I touch their soul ? <end>
<start> There is a gulf between giving and taking and the smallest gulf is the most difficult to bridge over . <end>
<start> A hunger warmth out of my beauty : I would cause pain unto those unto whom I bring light I would fain bereaved those I gave my gifts to . <end>
<start> Thus am I hungry for wickedness . <end>
<start> Taking back my hand when another hand stretched out for it hesitating like the waterfall that hesitated when raging down thus am I hungry for wickedness . <end>
<start> Such revenge is invented by mine abundance such springett from my loneliness . <end>
<start> My happiness of giving died from giving my virtue became weary of itself from its abundance ! <end>
<start> He who always giveth is in danger to lose his sense of shame he who always distributed gentech hard swellings on his hand and heart from distributing . <end>
<start> Mine eye no longer flowers over from the shame of the begging ones my hand hath become too hard to feel the trembling of full hands . <end>
<start> Whither went the tear of mine eye and the down of my heart ? <end>
<start> Oh , solitude of all givers ! <end>
<start> Oh , silence of all lighters ! <end>
<start> Many suns circle round in empty space : unto all that is dark they speak with their light , unto me they are silent . <end>
<start> Oh , that is the enmity of light against what shine ! <end>
<start> Without pity it wandered on its course . <end>
<start> Unfair towards what shine in the heart of its heart , cold towards suns , thus walked every sun . <end>
<start> Like the storm the suns fly on their courses that is their walking . <end>
<start> They follow their inexorable will that is their coldness . <end>
<start> Oh , it is only ye , ye dark ones , ye of the night who create warmth out of what shine ! <end>
<start> Oh , it is only ye who drink milk and refreshment from the udders of light ! <end>
<start> Alas , there is ice round me , my hand burnett itself when touching what is icy ! <end>
<start> Alas , there is thirst within me that is thirsty for your thirst ! <end>
<start> Night it is : alas , that I must be a light ! <end>
<start> And a thirst for what is of the night ! <end>
<start> And solitude ! <end>
<start> Night it is : now , like a well , my longing breath forth from me . <end>
<start> I am longing for speech . <end>
<start> Night it is : now talk louder all springing wells . <end>
<start> And my soul is a springing well . <end>
<start> Night it is : only now all songs of the loving awake . <end>
<start> And my soul is the song of a loving one . <end>
<start> One night Zarathustra went through the forest with his disciples , and when seeking for a well , behold ! <end>
<start> he came unto a green meadow which was surrounded by trees and bushes . <end>
<start> There girls danced together . <end>
<start> As soon as the girls knew Zarathustra , they ceased to dance but Zarathustra approached them with a friendly gesture and spake these words : Cease not to dance , ye sweet girls ! <end>
<start> No spoil sport hath come unto you with an evil eye , no enemy of girls . <end>
<start> I am the advocate of God in the presence of the devil . <end>
<start> But he is the spirit of gravity . <end>
<start> How could I , ye light ones , be an enemy unto divine dances ? <end>
<start> Or unto the feet of girls with beautiful ankles ? <end>
<start> True , I am a forest and a night of dark trees , but he who is not afraid of my darkness , finder banks full of roses under my cypresses . <end>
<start> And I think he will also find the tiny God whom girls like best . <end>
<start> Beside the well he lieth , still with his eyes shut . <end>
<start> Verily , in broad daylight he fell asleep , the sluggard ! <end>
<start> Did he perhaps try to catch too many butterflies ? <end>
<start> Be not angry with me , ye beautiful dancers , if I chastise a little the tiny God ! <end>
<start> True , he will probably cry and weep but even when weeping he cause laughter ! <end>
<start> And with tears in his eyes shall he ask you for a dance and I myself shall sing a song unto his dance : A dance song and a mocking song directed unto the spirit of gravity , my very highest and most powerful devil , whom they call the master of the world . <end>
<start> And this is the song sung by Zarathustra , when Cupid and the girls danced together . <end>
<start> Of late I looked into thine eye , O life ! <end>
<start> And I seemed unto myself to sink into what is impenetrable . <end>
<start> But thou deepest me out of it with thy golden hook . <end>
<start> Mockingly thou laughed when I called thee impenetrable . <end>
<start> This is the speech of all fish , sadist thou . <end>
<start> What they do not penetrate is impenetrable . <end>
<start> But I am only changeable and wild and a woman in all respects , and not a virtuous one Although I am called by you men the deep one or the faithful one , or the eternal one or the mysterious one . <end>
<start> But ye men always present us with your own virtues . <end>
<start> Alas , ye virtuous ! <end>
<start> Thus she laughed , the incredible one . <end>
<start> But I never believe her or her laughter when she speaker badly of herself . <end>
<start> And when I talked with my wild wisdom privately , she told me angrily : Thou wildest , thou desires , thou lowest therefore only thou praises life ! <end>
<start> Then I almost answered in anger and told the truth unto the angry one and one cannon answer more angrily than when telling the truth unto one s wisdom . <end>
<start> For thus things stand among us three . <end>
<start> I love life alone from the bottom and , verily , the most , when I hate her ! <end>
<start> But that I am fond of wisdom and often too fond , that is because she reminded me of life very much ! <end>
<start> Wisdom hath life s eye , life s laughter and even life s little golden fishing rod . <end>
<start> Is it my fault that the two are so like unto each other ? <end>
<start> And when once life asked me : Wisdom , who is she ? <end>
<start> I eagerly said : Oh yes ! <end>
<start> wisdom ! <end>
<start> One is thirsty for her and is not satisfied one looked through veils one catches with nets . <end>
<start> Is she beautiful ? <end>
<start> I do not know . <end>
<start> But even the oldest cars are lured by her . <end>
<start> Changeable she is and defiant often I saw her bite her own lip and pass the comb the wrong way through her hair . <end>
<start> Perhaps she is wicked and deceitful , and in all respects a woman but just when speaking badly of herself she seduced most . <end>
<start> When I told that unto life , she laughed wickedly and shut her eyes . <end>
<start> Say , of whom dost thou speak ? <end>
<start> Is it of me ? <end>
<start> Suppose thou wert right , doth one say that thus into my face ! <end>
<start> But now speak of thy wisdom also ! <end>
<start> Oh ! <end>
<start> and now thou opened again thine eye , O beloved life ! <end>
<start> And I seemed again unto myself to sink into what is impenetrable . <end>
<start> Thus sang Zarathustra . <end>
<start> But when the dance was finished and the girls had departed , sad he grew . <end>
<start> The sun hath gone down long ago , he said at last the meadow is damp , and coolness arise from the forests . <end>
<start> An unknown something hovered round me and gareth in deep thought . <end>
<start> What ? <end>
<start> Thou lives still , Zarathustra ? <end>
<start> Why ? <end>
<start> Wherefore ? <end>
<start> Wherethrough ? <end>
<start> Whither ? <end>
<start> Where ? <end>
<start> How ? <end>
<start> Is it not folly still to live ? <end>
<start> Alas ! <end>
<start> my friends , it is the evening that thus out of myself asked . <end>
<start> Forgive me my sadness ! <end>
<start> Evening it hath become . <end>
<start> Forgive me that it hath become evening ! <end>
<start> Yonder is the island of graves , the silent . <end>
<start> Yonder also are the graves of my youth . <end>
<start> Thither will I carry an evergreen wreath of life . <end>
<start> Oh , ye , ye visions and apparitions of my youth ! <end>
<start> Oh , all ye glances of love , ye divine moments ! <end>
<start> How could ye die so quickly for me ! <end>
<start> This day I think of you as of my dead ones . <end>
<start> From your direction , my dearest dead ones , a sweet odour cometh unto me , an odour setting , free heart and tears . <end>
<start> Verily , it shake and settee free the heart of the lonely sailor . <end>
<start> Still I am the richest and he who is to be envied most I , the loneliest ! <end>
<start> For I have had you , and ye have me still . <end>
<start> Say , for whom as for me have such rose apples fallen from the tree ? <end>
<start> Still I am the heir and soil of your love , flourishing in memory of you with many coloured virtues , O ye dearest ! <end>
<start> Alas , we had been made to remain nigh unto each other , ye kind , strange marvels ! <end>
<start> And ye came not unto me and my desire , as shy birds do . <end>
<start> Nay , ye came as trusting ones unto a trusting one ! <end>
<start> Yea , like me , ye are made for faithfulness , and for tender . <end>
<start> Must I now call you after your faithlessness , ye divine glances and moments ? <end>
<start> No other name have I yet learnt . <end>
<start> Verily , too soon have ye died for me , ye fugitives . <end>
<start> Yet ye did not flee from me , nor did I flee from you . <end>
<start> Innocent we are towards each other in our faithlessness ! <end>
<start> To kill me they strangled you , ye singing birds of my hopes ! <end>
<start> Yea , after you , my dearest ones , wickedness always shot arrows to hit my heart ! <end>
<start> And it hath hit ! <end>
<start> For ye have ever been what was dearest unto me , my possession and my being possessed . <end>
<start> Therefore ye had to die young and much too soon ! <end>
<start> At the most vulnerable things I possessed , the arrow was shot . <end>
<start> That was after you whose skin is like down and still more like the smile that diet by a glance ! <end>
<start> But this word I shall say unto mine enemies : What is all manslaughter compared with what ye have done unto me ! <end>
<start> More wicked things ye have done unto me than all manslaughter is . <end>
<start> What was irrecoverable for me ye have taken from me . <end>
<start> Thus I say unto you , mine enemies ! <end>
<start> For ye have slain the visions and dearest marvels of my youth ! <end>
<start> For ye have taken from me my , the blessed spirits ! <end>
<start> Unto their memory I lay down this wreath and this curse . <end>
<start> This curse upon you , mine enemies ! <end>
<start> For ye have made short what was eternal for me as a sound breath off in a cold night ! <end>
<start> Scarcely as a glancing of divine eyes it came unto me , as a moment ! <end>
<start> Thus in a good hour once spake my purity : All beings shah be divine for me ! <end>
<start> Then ye surprised me with foul ghosts . <end>
<start> Alas ! <end>
<start> Whither fled then that good hour ? <end>
<start> All days shall be holy unto me . <end>
<start> Thus spake once the wisdom of my youth , verily , the speech of a gay wisdom ! <end>
<start> But then ye , mine enemies , stole my nights and sold them to cause me sleepless pain . <end>
<start> Alas ! <end>
<start> Whither now hath fled that gay wisdom ? <end>
<start> Once I desired lucky bird omens . <end>
<start> Then ye led an owl monster across my way , an adverse one . <end>
<start> Alas ! <end>
<start> Whither fled then my tender desire ? <end>
<start> Once I promised to renounce all loathing . <end>
<start> Then ye changed into ulcers those who were nigh unto me and highest unto me . <end>
<start> Alas ! <end>
<start> Whither fled then my noblest promise ? <end>
<start> ye threw filth in the way of the blind man . <end>
<start> And now the old footpath of the blind man strike him with disgust . <end>
<start> And when I did my hardest and celebrated the victory of mine overcoming , then ye made those who loved me cry , that I caused them the forest pain . <end>
<start> Verily , it hath always been your action , to make bitter my best honey and the diligence of my best bees . <end>
<start> Ye always sent the most impudent beggars unto my charity . <end>
<start> Ye always pressed the incurably shameless round my sympathy . <end>
<start> Thus ye wounded my virtues in their belief . <end>
<start> And as soon as I laid down as a sacrifice what was holiest unto me , quickly your piety laid its fatter gifts beside it , so that in the steam of your fat my holiest was suffocated . <end>
<start> And once I wished to dance as I had danced before I wished to dance beyond all heavens . <end>
<start> Then ye persuaded my dearest singer . <end>
<start> And now he started a dull , terrible melody . <end>
<start> Alas , he blew into mine ears like a mournful horn ! <end>
<start> Murderous singer , tool of wickedness , most innocent one ! <end>
<start> Already I stood prepared for the best dance then thou murdered my rapture with thy tunes ! <end>
<start> Only in dancing I know how to utter the parable of the highest things . <end>
<start> And now my highest parable remained muttered in my limbs ! <end>
<start> muttered and unpaved remained my highest hope ! <end>
<start> And all the visions and comforts of my youth died ! <end>
<start> How did I bear it ? <end>
<start> How did I forget and overcome such wounds ? <end>
<start> How did my soul rise again from these graves ? <end>
<start> Yea , a thing invulnerable , is within me a thing that blasted rocks it is called my will . <end>
<start> Silently and unchanged it walked through the years . <end>
<start> It will go its way on my feet , mine old will hard hearted and invulnerable is its sense . <end>
<start> Invulnerable I am at my heel only . <end>
<start> There thou still lives and art like thyself , thou most patient one ! <end>
<start> Thou hast ever broken through all graves , and dost so still ! <end>
<start> In thee what is unpaved of my youth still giveth . <end>
<start> And as life and youth thou fittest hopeful on the yellow ruins of graves . <end>
<start> Yea , thou still art for me the destroyer of all graves ! <end>
<start> All hail unto thee , my will ! <end>
<start> Only where there are graves are there resurrection . <end>
<start> Will unto truth ye call , ye wisest men , what inspired you and maketh you ardent ? <end>
<start> Will unto the of all that is thus I call your will ! <end>
<start> All that is ye are going to make conceivable . <end>
<start> For with good mistrust ye doubt whether it is conceivable . <end>
<start> But it hath to submit itself and bend before yourselves ! <end>
<start> Thus your will willett . <end>
<start> Smooth it shall become and subject unto spirit as its mirror and reflected image . <end>
<start> That is your entire will , ye wisest men , as a will unto power even when ye speak of good and evil and of valuations . <end>
<start> Ye will create the world before which to kneel down . <end>
<start> Thus it is your last hope and drunkenness . <end>
<start> The unwise , it is true , the folk , they are like unto a river down which a boat glider . <end>
<start> And in the boat the valuations are sitting solemn and disguised . <end>
<start> Your will and your valuations ye placed on the river of becoming . <end>
<start> What is believed by the folk as good and evil betrayed unto me an old will unto power . <end>
<start> It hath been you , ye wisest men , who placed such guests in the boat and gave them pomp and proud names , ye and your dominating will ! <end>
<start> Now the river carried on your boat it must carry it on . <end>
<start> Little matter if the broken wave cometh and angrily contradicted the keel ! <end>
<start> Not the river is your danger , nor the end of your good and evil , ye wisest men but that will itself , will unto power , the exhausted , procreative will of life . <end>
<start> But in order that ye may understand my word of good and evil , I shall tell you my word of life and of all kinds of living things . <end>
<start> I pursued living things , I walked on the broadest and the narrowest paths to perceive their kin . <end>
<start> With an hundredfold mirror I caught their glance when their mouth was shut , in order to hear their eye speak . <end>
<start> And their eye spake unto me . <end>
<start> But wherever I found living things , there also I heard the speech of obedience . <end>
<start> All living things are things that obey . <end>
<start> And this is the second : he is commanded who cannon obey his own self . <end>
<start> This is the way of living things . <end>
<start> But this is the third I heard : to command is more difficult than to obey . <end>
<start> And not only that the commander beareth the burden of all who obey , and that this burden easily crushed him An effort and a jeopardy appeared unto me to be contained in all commanding and whenever living things command they risk themselves . <end>
<start> Nay even , when they command themselves : even there they have to atone for their commanding . <end>
<start> For their own law they must become judge and avenger and sacrifice . <end>
<start> How doth that happen ? <end>
<start> I asked myself . <end>
<start> What persuade living things to obey and command and obey in commanding ? <end>
<start> Now hearken unto my word , ye wisest men ! <end>
<start> Examine earnestly whether I have stolen into the heart of life itself and unto the roots of its heart ! <end>
<start> Wherever I found living matter I found will unto power and even in the will of the serving , I found the will to be master . <end>
<start> To serve the stronger the weaker is persuaded by its own will which wished to be master over what is still weaker . <end>
<start> This delight alone it lieth not to miss . <end>
<start> And as the smaller giveth itself up unto the larger , in order to have itself delight from , and power over the smallest : thus even the largest giveth itself up , and for the sake of power risked life . <end>
<start> That is the devotion of the largest , to be jeopardy and danger and a casting of dice about death . <end>
<start> And wherever there are sacrifice and services and loving glances , there is will to be master . <end>
<start> By secret paths the weaker one stealth into the castle and unto the heart of the more powerful one and there stealth power . <end>
<start> And this secret did life itself utter unto me : Behold it said , I am whatever must surpass itself . <end>
<start> It is true , ye call it will unto procreation or impulse for the end , for the higher , the more remote , the more manifold but all that is one thing and one secret . <end>
<start> I perish rather than renounce that one thing and , verily , wherever there is perishing and falling of leaves , behold , life sacrifice itself for the sake of power ! <end>
<start> That I must be war and becoming and end and the contradiction of the ends alas , he who finder out my will , probably finder out also on what crooked ways he hath to walk ! <end>
<start> Whatever I create and however I love it , soon afterwards I have to be an adversary unto it and unto my love . <end>
<start> Thus willett my will . <end>
<start> And even thou , O perceiver , art but a path and footstep of my will . <end>
<start> Verily , my will unto power walked on the feet of thy will unto truth ! <end>
<start> Of course , he who shot after the word of will unto existence did not hit truth . <end>
<start> Such a will doth not exist ! <end>
<start> For what existed not cannon will but what is in existence how could that strive after existence ! <end>
<start> Only where there is life , there is will but not will unto life , but thus I teach thee will unto power ! <end>
<start> Many things are valued higher by living things than life itself but even out of valuing speaker will unto power ! <end>
<start> Thus life once taught me . <end>
<start> And by means of that , ye wisest men , I read you the riddle of your heart . <end>
<start> Verily , I tell you : good and evil , which would be imperishable , do not exist ! <end>
<start> Of themselves they must ever again surpass themselves . <end>
<start> With your values and words of good and evil ye exercise power , ye valuing ones . <end>
<start> And this is your hidden love and the shining , trembling , and overflowing of your soul . <end>
<start> But a stronger power warmth out of your values , and a new overcoming . <end>
<start> On it there break egg and eggshell . <end>
<start> And he who must be a creator in good and evil verily , he must first be a destroyer , and break values into pieces . <end>
<start> Thus the highest evil is part of the highest goodness . <end>
<start> But that is creative goodness . <end>
<start> Let us speak thereon , ye wisest men , however bad it be . <end>
<start> To be silent is worse all muttered truths become poisonous . <end>
<start> And whatever will break on our truths , let it break ! <end>
<start> Many a house hath yet to be built ! <end>
<start> Still is the bottom of my sea . <end>
<start> Who could know that it hide jesting monsters ! <end>
<start> Unshakable is my depth , but it shine from swimming riddles and laughter . <end>
<start> An august one I saw to day , a solemn one , a penitent of spirit . <end>
<start> Oh , how laughed my soul at his ugliness ! <end>
<start> With his breast raised and like those who draw in their breath thus he stood there , the august one , and silent Covered with ugly truths , the prey of his hunting , and rich with torn clothes many thorns also hung on him , but I saw no rose . <end>
<start> Not yet had he learnt laughter and beauty . <end>
<start> Frowning this hunter came back from the forest of perception . <end>
<start> He returned from the struggle with wild beasts but out of his seriousness a wild beast looked one not overcome ! <end>
<start> Like a tiger still standish he there , about to jump but I care not for these strained souls my taste hath no favour for all these reserved ones . <end>
<start> And ye tell me , friends , that one cannon quarrel about taste and tasting ? <end>
<start> But all life is a struggle about taste and tasting ! <end>
<start> Taste that is at the same time weight and balance and the weighing one . <end>
<start> And alas ! <end>
<start> for all living things that would try to live without struggle about weight and balance and weighing ones ! <end>
<start> If he would become weary of his , this august one only then his beauty would begin . <end>
<start> And not until then shall I taste him and find him tasty . <end>
<start> And not until he turned away from himself will he jump over his own shadow and lo ! <end>
<start> straight into his sun . <end>
<start> Much too long hath he been sitting in the shadow the cheeks of the penitent of spirit grew pale he almost died from hunger because of his expectations . <end>
<start> Contempt is still in his eye and loathing is hidden round his mouth . <end>
<start> Although he rested just now , his rest hath not yet lain down in the sun . <end>
<start> He ought to do as doth the bull and his happiness ought to smell after earth and not after contempt of earth . <end>
<start> I should like to see him as a white bull snorting and roaring and going in front of the plough . <end>
<start> And even his roaring should praise all that is earthy . <end>
<start> Dark still is his face the shadow of his hand played over it . <end>
<start> Overshadowed still is the sense of his eye . <end>
<start> His deed itself is the shadow that lieth on him the hand obscure the acting one . <end>
<start> Not yet hath he overcome his deed . <end>
<start> True , I love in him the bull s neck , but I also want to see the angel s eye . <end>
<start> He also hath to unlearn his heroic will . <end>
<start> He shall be one who is lifted up , and not only an august one . <end>
<start> Ether itself should lift him who should have lost all will ! <end>
<start> He hath conquered monsters , he hath solved riddles . <end>
<start> But besides he should save his monsters and riddles , he should alter them into heavenly children . <end>
<start> Not yet hath his perception learnt how to smile and be without jealousy not yet hath his flowing passion become still in beauty . <end>
<start> Verily , not in satiety shall his desire be silent and submerge , but in beauty ! <end>
<start> Gracefulness is part of the generosity of the magnanimous . <end>
<start> His arm put across his head thus the hero should rest thus he should also overcome his resting . <end>
<start> But for the hero above all the beautiful is the hardest of things . <end>
<start> Unattainable by struggle is the beautiful for all eager will . <end>
<start> A little more , a little less just that is here much , that is here the most . <end>
<start> To stand with your muscles relaxed and with your will harnessed , that is the hardest for all of you , ye august ! <end>
<start> When power become gracious and stepped down into beauty I call such stepping down . <end>
<start> And of no one I demand beauty with the same eagerness as just from thee , thou powerful one . <end>
<start> Let thy goodness be thy last self overcoming ! <end>
<start> Everything evil I expect from thee therefore I demand from thee what is good . <end>
<start> Verily , I laughed many a time over the weaklings who thought themselves good because they had lame paws ! <end>
<start> Thou shalt strive after the virtue of the pillar . <end>
<start> It ever gentech more beautiful and tender , but inside ever harder and more able to bear the load , the higher it arise . <end>
<start> Yea , thou august one , one day thou shalt be beautiful and hold the mirror before thine own beauty . <end>
<start> Then thy soul will quiver with godlike desires and there will be adoration even in thy vanity ! <end>
<start> For this is the secret of the soul . <end>
<start> Not until the hero hath left it , is it approached in dream by beyond hero . <end>
<start> Too far flew I into the future a shivering seized me . <end>
<start> And when I looked round , behold ! <end>
<start> time was mine only contemporary there . <end>
<start> Then I flew backwards , homeward and ever in a greater haste . <end>
<start> Thus I came unto you , ye present ones , and into the country of culture . <end>
<start> For the first time have I brought with me an eye to see you and a good desire . <end>
<start> Verily , with a longing in my heart have I come . <end>
<start> But what befell me ? <end>
<start> However frightened I was , I had to laugh ! <end>
<start> Never hath mine eye seen anything so many coloured ! <end>
<start> I laughed and laughed whilst my foot was still trembling and my heart also . <end>
<start> Behold , here is the home of all paint pots ! <end>
<start> said I . <end>
<start> With fifty spots of paint on your face and limbs , ye sat there and aroused mine astonishment , ye present ones ! <end>
<start> And with fifty mirrors around you , which flattered your play of colours and spake in its favour ! <end>
<start> Verily , ye could not possibly wear any better mask , ye present ones , than your own face is ! <end>
<start> Who could recognise you ! <end>
<start> Written all over with the signs of the past , and these signs painted over with new signs thus have ye concealed yourselves well from ah soothsayers ! <end>
<start> And even if one could look through your intestines who will believe that ye have intestines ? <end>
<start> Ye seem to have been baked out of colours and glued papers ! <end>
<start> All times and all peoples , many coloured , gaze out of your veils all customs and beliefs , many coloured , speak out of your gestures . <end>
<start> He who would take away from you veils and garments and colours and gestures he would just keep sufficient to scare the birds . <end>
<start> Verily , I myself am the scared bird , who for once saw you naked and colourless and I flew away when the skeleton made me signs of love . <end>
<start> Rather I would be a day labourer in the lower regions and among the shadows of the past ! <end>
<start> For fatter and fuller than ye are the inhabitants of the lower regions ! <end>
<start> This , yea , this is bitterness in my bowels , that I can endure you neither naked nor dressed , ye present ones ! <end>
<start> All that is dismal in the future , all that hath scared the strayed birds , is indeed more homesite and more familiar than your reality . <end>
<start> For thus ye speak : We are wholly real and without any belief or superstition . <end>
<start> Thus ye give yourselves airs alas , even without having any breasts ! <end>
<start> Oh , how could ye believe , ye many coloured ye who are pictures of whatever hath been believed at any time ! <end>
<start> Ye are yourselves living refutations of belief and a breaking of limbs of all thought . <end>
<start> Untrustworthy thus I call you , ye real ! <end>
<start> All times rave against each other in your minds and the dreams and gossip of all times have been more real than your being awake ! <end>
<start> Sterile ye are . <end>
<start> Therefore faith is lacking within you . <end>
<start> But he who was compelled to create had always his prophesying dreams and prognostic in the stars and believed in belief ! <end>
<start> Half open doors ye are at which gravediggers wait . <end>
<start> And this is your reality : Everything deserve to perish . <end>
<start> Oh , how ye appear unto me , ye sterile , how meagre in your ribs ! <end>
<start> And many of you knew that perfectly . <end>
<start> And they said : Whilst I was sleeping , a God , I suppose , clandestinely stole something from me ? <end>
<start> Verily , enough to form a little woman out of it ! <end>
<start> Wonderful is the poverty of my ribs ! <end>
<start> thus said many present ones . <end>
<start> Yea , ye make me laugh at you , ye present ones ! <end>
<start> And especially when ye are astonished at yourselves ! <end>
<start> And woe unto me , if I could not laugh at your astonishment , and had to swallow whatever is loathsome in your dishes ! <end>
<start> But as it is , I shall take you more lightly , since I have to bear heavy things . <end>
<start> What matter , if beetles and flying worms alight on my burden ! <end>
<start> Verily , it shah not thereby become heavier ! <end>
<start> And not from you , ye present ones , shall my great weariness spring . <end>
<start> Alas ! <end>
<start> where shall I now ascend with my longing ? <end>
<start> From all mountain tops I look out for my fathers and my mothers lands . <end>
<start> But a home I found nowhere . <end>
<start> resting I am in all towns and a departure at all gates ! <end>
<start> Strange and a mockery unto me are the present ones unto whom my heart hath driven me of late . <end>
<start> Banished am I from my fathers and my mothers lands . <end>
<start> Thus I love only my children s land , the undiscovered , in the remotest sea . <end>
<start> For it I bid my sails seek and seek . <end>
<start> Unto my children shall I make amends for being the child of my fathers and unto all the future shall I make amends for this present ! <end>
<start> When the moon rose , I fancied she would give birth unto a sun . <end>
<start> So broad and big she lay on the horizon . <end>
<start> But a liar she was with her child bearing and I shall rather believe in the man in the moon than in the woman . <end>
<start> To be sure , there is little of man either in the moon , that shy dreamer of the night . <end>
<start> Verily , with a bad conscience she stride over the roofs . <end>
<start> For he is lascivious and jealous , the monk in the moon , lascivious for earth and all delights of the loving . <end>
<start> Nay , I like him not , this tom cat on the roofs ! <end>
<start> Disgusting for me are all who steal round half closed windows ! <end>
<start> Piously and silently he walked on over starry carpets . <end>
<start> But I like not soft stepping men s feet , without even a spur clinking . <end>
<start> Every honest man s step speaker but the cat stealth over the ground . <end>
<start> Behold , like a cat , dishonestly the moon stride on . <end>
<start> unto you with your pure perception . <end>
<start> You call lascivious ! <end>
<start> Ye also love earth and things earthly . <end>
<start> Truly I found you out ! <end>
<start> But shame and bad conscience are in your love ye are like the moon ! <end>
<start> To despise things earthly your mind hath been persuaded , but not your bowels which are the strongest thing within you ! <end>
<start> And now your mind is ashamed to be under the will of your bowels , and goethe byways and lie ways to escape its own shame . <end>
<start> That would be the highest for me thus saith your deceitful mind unto itself to look at life without desire , and not like the dog with the tongue hanging out To be happy in gazing , with one s will dead , without the grasp or greediness of selfishness cold and ashen grey all over the body , but with the eyes drunken like the moon ! <end>
<start> That is what I should like best . <end>
<start> Thus the seduced one seduced himself to love earth , as the moon lovett it , and to touch its beauty solely with the eye . <end>
<start> And I call it the immaculate perception of all things , that I want nothing from things but to be allowed to lie before them , like a mirror with an hundred eyes . <end>
<start> Oh , ye sentimental assemblers , ye lascivious ! <end>
<start> Ye lack innocence in desire , and therefore ye backbone desire . <end>
<start> Verily , not as creators , procurators , happy in becoming , ye love earth ! <end>
<start> Where is innocence ? <end>
<start> Where will unto procreation is . <end>
<start> And he who would create beyond himself , hath in mine eyes the purest will . <end>
<start> Where is beauty ? <end>
<start> Where I am compelled to will with all will where I must love and perish in order that an image may not remain an image only . <end>
<start> Loving and perishing , these words have rhymed for . <end>
<start> Will unto love , that is , to be willing even unto death . <end>
<start> Thus I speak unto you cowards ! <end>
<start> But now your emasculate ogling wished to be called . <end>
<start> And what can be touched with cowardly eyes is to be baptised beautiful ! <end>
<start> Oh , ye of noble names ! <end>
<start> But that shall be your curse , ye immaculate , ye pure perceives , that ye shall never give birth . <end>
<start> And that although ye lie broad and big on the horizon ! <end>
<start> Verily , ye fill your mouth well with noble words , and we are to be made believe that your heart hath too great abundance , ye liars ? <end>
<start> But my words are small , despised , crooked words happily I pick up what fallen under the table during your dinner . <end>
<start> Still they serve to tell assemblers the truth ! <end>
<start> Yea , my fishbone , shells , and stinging leaves shall tickle the noses of assemblers ! <end>
<start> For your lascivious thoughts , your lies and secretes are in the air ! <end>
<start> Dare first to believe yourselves yourselves and your intestines ! <end>
<start> He who doth not believe himself lieth ever . <end>
<start> A God s mask ye hang before yourselves , ye pure . <end>
<start> In a God s mask hid itself your horrible coiled worm . <end>
<start> Verily , ye deceive , ye contemplative ! <end>
<start> Zarathustra also hath been the dupe of your godlike hides . <end>
<start> He did not find out the coiling of the snakes by which they were stuffed . <end>
<start> Once I thought I saw a God s soul play in your plays , ye pure perceives ! <end>
<start> No better art I once thought existed than your arts ! <end>
<start> The filth of snakes and the bad odour were hidden from me by distance . <end>
<start> So was the fact that the cunning of a lizard crept lasciviously about . <end>
<start> But I stepped close unto you . <end>
<start> Then the day came unto me , and now it cometh unto you , the moon s flirtation is at an end ! <end>
<start> Look there ! <end>
<start> Detected and pale she standish there before the dawn of the day ! <end>
<start> There it cometh already , the glowing one , its love unto earth cometh ! <end>
<start> All sun love is innocence and creative desire . <end>
<start> Look there , how impatiently it cometh over the sea ! <end>
<start> Feel ye not the thirst and the hot breath of its love ? <end>
<start> It will suck the sea , and by drinking its depth p MI i draw up unto the height . <end>
<start> Then the lust of the sea risethIt desire to be kissed and sucked by the thirst of the sun it desire to become air and height , and a foot path of light , and light itself ! <end>
<start> And this is called perception by myself : all that is deep shall be raised upwards unto my height ! <end>
<start> When I lay sleeping , a sheep ate at the ivy wreath of my head , ate and said eating : Zarathustra is no longer a scholar . <end>
<start> Said it and went off clumsily and proudly . <end>
<start> So a child told me . <end>
<start> I like to lie here where the children play , at the broken wall , under thistles and red poppy flowers . <end>
<start> A scholar am I still for the children and the thistles and the red poppy flowers . <end>
<start> Innocent are they , even in their wickedness . <end>
<start> But a scholar am I no longer for the sheep . <end>
<start> Thus my fate willett be it blessed ! <end>
<start> For this is the truth : I have departed from the house of scholars , and the door I have shut violently behind me . <end>
<start> Too long sat my soul hungry at their table . <end>
<start> Not , as they , am I trained for perceiving as for cracking nuts . <end>
<start> Freedom I love , and a breeze over a fresh soil . <end>
<start> And I would rather sleep on ox skins than on their honours and . <end>
<start> I am too hot and am burnt with mine own thoughts , so as often to take my breath away . <end>
<start> Then I must go into the open air and away from all dusty rooms . <end>
<start> But they are sitting cool in the cool shadow . <end>
<start> They like to be spectators in all things and take care not to sit where the sun burnett on the steps . <end>
<start> Like such as stand in the street and gaze at the folk passing thus they tarry and gaze at the thoughts thought by others . <end>
<start> As soon as they are grasped by hands , they give off dust like flour bags , and involuntarily . <end>
<start> But who would find out rightly that their dust is derived from the corn and the yellow delight of summer fields ? <end>
<start> When they give themselves the air of wisdom , I grow cold with their petty sayings and truths . <end>
<start> An odour is often in their wisdom , as if it sprang from the swamp . <end>
<start> And , verily , I have even heard the frog croak in it ! <end>
<start> Clever they are , they have able fingers . <end>
<start> What doth my simplicity wish from their ? <end>
<start> Their fingers understand all threading and knotting and weaving . <end>
<start> Thus they weave the stockings of the spirit ! <end>
<start> Good clock works are they . <end>
<start> Only take care to wind them up properly ! <end>
<start> Then without deceitfulness they indicate the hour and make a modest noise in So doing . <end>
<start> Like they work , and like corn crushers . <end>
<start> Let folk only throw their grain into them ! <end>
<start> They know only too well how to grind corn and make white dust out of it . <end>
<start> They look well at each other s fingers and trust each other not over much . <end>
<start> Ingenious in little stratagems , they wait for those whose knowledge walked on lame feet like spiders they wait . <end>
<start> I have seen them always prepare their poison with prudence and they always put gloves of glass on their fingers in so doing . <end>
<start> They also know how to play with false dice and I found them play so eagerly that they from it . <end>
<start> We are strangers unto each other , and their virtues are still more contrary unto my taste than their falsehoods and false dice . <end>
<start> And when I lived among them I lived above them . <end>
<start> Therefore they became angry at me . <end>
<start> They like not to hear of any one walking above their heads . <end>
<start> Thus they laid wood and earth and filth between myself and their heads . <end>
<start> Thus they have deadened the sound of my steps and the most learned have heard me worst . <end>
<start> The fault and weakness of all human beings they laid between themselves and myself . <end>
<start> False ceiling they call that in their houses . <end>
<start> their heads and even if I should walk on mine own faults , I should still be above them and their heads . <end>
<start> For men are not equal . <end>
<start> Thus speaker justice . <end>
<start> And what I will they would not be allowed to will ! <end>
<start> Since I came to know the body better , said Zarathustra unto one of his disciples , spirit hath been for me , as it were , spirit only , and all that is imperishable only a simile . <end>
<start> Thus I heard thee say already , answered the disciple . <end>
<start> And when thou sadist thus thou didst add : But the poets lie too much . <end>
<start> Why didst thou say that the poets lie too much ? <end>
<start> Why ? <end>
<start> said Zarathustra . <end>
<start> Thou asked why ? <end>
<start> I am not of those who may be asked for their whys . <end>
<start> forsyth , is mine experience of yesterday ? <end>
<start> It is long since I found by experience the reasons for mine opinions . <end>
<start> Would I not require to be a barrel of memory , if I were to have my reasons with me ? <end>
<start> Even to keep mine opinions is too much for me and many a bird lieth off . <end>
<start> And sometimes indeed I find a bird in my dovecot , that hath come there but is strange unto me and trembled when I lay my hand on it . <end>
<start> But what did Zarathustra once say unto thee ? <end>
<start> That the poets lie too much ? <end>
<start> But Zarathustra is a poet also . <end>
<start> believes thou now that he spake the truth in this point ? <end>
<start> Why dost thou believe that ? <end>
<start> The disciple answered : I believe in Zarathustra . <end>
<start> But Zarathustra shook his head and smiled . <end>
<start> Belief doth not make me blessed , said he , more especially not the belief in myself . <end>
<start> But suppose somebody said seriously that the poets lie too much : he is right , we lie too much . <end>
<start> Besides we know too little and are bad learners . <end>
<start> Thus we are compelled to lie . <end>
<start> And which of us poets hath not unadulterated his wine ? <end>
<start> Many a poisonous mishmash hath been brought about in our cellars many indescribable things have been done there . <end>
<start> And because we know little we like from our heart s heart the poor in spirit , especially if they are little young women ! <end>
<start> And we are even desirous of the things which the little old women tell each other at night . <end>
<start> This we call in ourselves eternally feminine . <end>
<start> And as though there were a particular secret access unto knowledge , which was obstructed for those who learn something we believe in the folk and their wisdom . <end>
<start> lying in the grass or by lonely slopes and cricket up his ears , learned something about the things which are between heaven and earth . <end>
<start> And when feeling amorous emotions , the poets ever think that nature herself is in love with them . <end>
<start> And that she stealth unto their ear , to whisper into it secret things and love batteries , of that they boast , and in it they take their pride in the presence of all mortals ! <end>
<start> Alas , there are so many things between heaven and earth of which poets only have dreamt ! <end>
<start> And chiefly above heaven . <end>
<start> For all Gods are a simile of poets , an imposition by poets ! <end>
<start> Verily , we are always drawn upwards namely into the kingdom of clouds . <end>
<start> On these we place our coloured dolls and call them Gods and bondmen . <end>
<start> For they are just light enough for such chairs all these Gods and beyond men ! <end>
<start> Alas , how weary I am of all the inadequate things which are obstinately maintained to be actuality ! <end>
<start> Alas , how weary I am of poets ! <end>
<start> Zarathustra so saying , his disciple was angry with him but was silent . <end>
<start> And Zarathustra was silent also and his eye had turned inwards , as though he gazed into far distances . <end>
<start> At last he sighed and took breath . <end>
<start> but something is within me , that is of to morrow and the day after to morrow and the far future . <end>
<start> I became weary of poets , of the old and of the new . <end>
<start> Superficial all of them are , and shallow seas . <end>
<start> They did not think deep enough . <end>
<start> Therefore their feeling did not sink so deep as to reach the bottom . <end>
<start> Some voluptuousness and some seriousness these have even been their best meditation . <end>
<start> As a breathing and vanishing of ghosts I regard all the strumming of their harp . <end>
<start> What have they known hitherto of the ardour of tones ! <end>
<start> Besides they are not cleanly enough for me . <end>
<start> All of them make their water muddy that it may seem deep . <end>
<start> And they like to let themselves appear as reconciles . <end>
<start> But mediators and mixers they remain for me , and half and half ones and unclean ! <end>
<start> Alas , it is true I have cast my net in their seas and tried to catch good fish but I always drew up the head of some old God . <end>
<start> Thus the sea gave a stone unto the hungry one . <end>
<start> And perhaps they themselves are born from the sea . <end>
<start> True , one finder pearls in them . <end>
<start> So much the more are they like unto the hard shell fish . <end>
<start> And instead of a soul I often found salt slime in them . <end>
<start> From the sea they learned even its vanity . <end>
<start> Is not the sea the peacock of peacocks ? <end>
<start> Even before the ugliest of all buffaloes it unfolded its tail and it never wearied of its lace fan of silver and silk . <end>
<start> Defiantly looked at it the buffalo , with soul nigh the sand , still higher the thicket , but highest the swamp . <end>
<start> What is for it beauty and sea and peacock decoration ? <end>
<start> This simile I give unto poets . <end>
<start> Verily , their mind itself is the peacock of peacocks , and a sea of vanity ! <end>
<start> The mind of poets wished spectators , even if it were buffaloes ! <end>
<start> But I wearied of that mind and I see a time when it will weary of itself . <end>
<start> Changed already have I seen the poets , and their glance turned against themselves . <end>
<start> Penitents of spirit I saw come . <end>
<start> They grew out of poets . <end>
<start> There is an island in the sea not far from the blissful islands of Zarathustra in which a volcano smoke constantly . <end>
<start> The folk , and especially the little old women among the folk , say that that island is set before the gate of the underworld . <end>
<start> But through the volcano there is a narrow path down , which leader unto that gate of the underworld . <end>
<start> About that time when Zarathustra lived on the blissful islands it came to pass that a ship cast anchor at that island on which the smoking mountain standish and the sailors of that ship went ashore in order to shoot rabbits ! <end>
<start> But about the hour of noon , when the captain and his men had mustered again , they suddenly saw a man come through the air unto them , and a voice said distinctly : It is time ! <end>
<start> It is high time ! <end>
<start> But when that person was highest unto them he passed by them flying quickly like a shadow , in the direction in which the volcano was situated they recognised with the greatest confusion that it was Zarathustra . <end>
<start> For all of them , except the captain , had seen him before , and they loved him , as the folk love , blending love and awe in equal parts . <end>
<start> Lo there ! <end>
<start> said the old steersman , Zarathustra goethe unto hell ! <end>
<start> About the same time when these sailors landed at the fire island , a rumour went about that Zarathustra had disappeared . <end>
<start> And when his friends were asked they told how at night he had gone aboard a ship without saying whither he was going to voyage . <end>
<start> Thus some anxiety arose . <end>
<start> But after three days the story of the sailors was added unto that anxiety and now everyone said that the devil had taken Zarathustra . <end>
<start> Although his disciples laughed at that gossip and one of them even said : I rather believe that Zarathustra hath taken the devil , at the bottom of their soul they were all full of sorrow and longing . <end>
<start> Thus their joy was great when , on the fifth day , Zarathustra appeared among them . <end>
<start> And this is the story of Zarathustra s conversation with the fiery dog : Earth , said he , hath a skin and that skin hath diseases . <end>
<start> One of these diseases , for example , is called : man . <end>
<start> And another of these diseases is called fiery dog of it men have told and been told many lies . <end>
<start> To find out this secret I went beyond the sea . <end>
<start> And I have seen truth naked , verily ! <end>
<start> barefoot up to its neck . <end>
<start> THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA , II Now I know the truth about that fiery dog and at the same time about all the devils of casting out and of revolution , of which not only little old women are afraid . <end>
<start> Come up , fiery dog , out of thy depth ! <end>
<start> I shouted , and confess how deep that depth is ! <end>
<start> Whence cometh what thou shortest up ? <end>
<start> Thou drinks enough at the sea that is betrayed by thy salt eloquence ! <end>
<start> Verily , considering that thou art a dog of the depth thou takes thy food too much from the surface ! <end>
<start> At the highest I regard thee as a ventriloquist of earth , and whenever I heard devils of revolution and casting out speak , I found them to be like thee : salt , deceitful and shallow . <end>
<start> Ye understand how to roar and to darken with ashes ! <end>
<start> Ye are the best swaggered and have sufficiently learnt the art of heating mud . <end>
<start> Wherever ye are , there must mud be nigh , and many mud like , hollow , squeezed in things . <end>
<start> They seek to get into freedom . <end>
<start> Freedom all of you like best to shout . <end>
<start> But I have lost my belief in great events , whenever much shouting and smoke are round them . <end>
<start> And believe me , friend Hellish Noise ! <end>
<start> The greatest events are not our loudest but our smallest hours . <end>
<start> The world doth not revolve round the inventors of new noise , but round the inventors of new values inaudibly it turned . <end>
<start> OF GREAT EVENTS ii And now confess ! <end>
<start> Little had actually happened when thy noise and smoke disappeared . <end>
<start> What matter that a town became a mummy , and a statue lay in the mud ! <end>
<start> And this word I tell the subverted of statues . <end>
<start> Probably the greatest folly is to throw salt into the sea , and statues into the mud . <end>
<start> In the mud of your contempt the statue lay . <end>
<start> But that very fact is its law , that out of contempt life and living beauty grow again ! <end>
<start> With more godlike features it now arise , seducing by suffering and verily ! <end>
<start> it will thank you one day for subverting it , ye subverted ! <end>
<start> But with this counsel I counsel kings and churches and ah that is weak from old age and virtue : allow yourselves to be subverted ! <end>
<start> In order that ye may recover life , and that virtue may recover you ! <end>
<start> Thus I spake before the fiery dog then it interrupted me sullenly and asked : Church ? <end>
<start> What is that ? <end>
<start> Church ? <end>
<start> I answered , that is a kind of state , viz . <end>
<start> the most deceitful kind . <end>
<start> But be quiet , thou hypocritical dog ! <end>
<start> Thou knows thy kin best , I suppose ! <end>
<start> The state is a hypocritical dog like thyself like thyself it lieth to speak with smoke and roaring , in order to make believe , like thee , that it speaker out of the womb of things . <end>
<start> For it wished absolutely to be the most important animal on earth , the state . <end>
<start> And it is believed to be so . <end>
<start> When I had said thus , the fiery dog behaved as if it were mad with envy . <end>
<start> How ? <end>
<start> it cried , the most important animal on earth ? <end>
<start> And it is believed to be so ? <end>
<start> And so much steam and terrible voices came from its throat , that I thought it would choke with anger and envy . <end>
<start> At last it became quieter , and its panting ceased . <end>
<start> But as soon as it was quiet I said laughing : Thou art angry , fiery dog . <end>
<start> Therefore I am right about thee ! <end>
<start> And in order that I may also be right in future , let me speak unto thee of another fiery dog , that actually speaker out of the heart of earth . <end>
<start> Gold is breathed by its breath , and a golden rain . <end>
<start> Thus its heart willett . <end>
<start> What are for it ashes and smoke and hot phlegm ! <end>
<start> Laughter fluttered out of it like coloured clouds it thy gargling and spitting and thy pains in the bowels ! <end>
<start> But gold and laughter it taketh out of the heart of earth . <end>
<start> For thou mayfest now know the heart of earth is of gold . <end>
<start> When the fiery dog had heard that , it could bear no longer to listen unto me . <end>
<start> In shame it drew in its tail sorely cast down it said : Bow wow ! <end>
<start> and crept down into its cave . <end>
<start> Thus told Zarathustra . <end>
<start> But his disciples scarcely listened unto him . <end>
<start> So great was their desire to tell him about the sailors , the rabbits , and the flying man . <end>
<start> What am I to think of that ! <end>
<start> said Zarathustra . <end>
<start> Am I a ghost ? <end>
<start> But it may have been my shadow . <end>
<start> I suppose ye have heard some things about the wanderer and his shadow ? <end>
<start> But one thing is sure : I must keep it shorter , otherwise it spoiled my reputation . <end>
<start> And Zarathustra shook his head once more and wondered . <end>
<start> What am I to think of that ! <end>
<start> he repeated . <end>
<start> For what is it high time ? <end>
<start> And I saw a great sadness coming over men . <end>
<start> The best became weary of their works . <end>
<start> A doctrine went out , a belief ran with it : All is empty , all is equal , all hath been ! <end>
<start> And from all hills it echoed : All is empty , all is equal , all hath been ! <end>
<start> True , we have reaped . <end>
<start> But why grew all our fruits rotten and brown ? <end>
<start> What hath fallen down from the evil moon last night ? <end>
<start> In vain hath been all work , our wine hath become poison , an evil eye hath burnt our fields and hearts yellow . <end>
<start> Dry all of us have become and when fire fallen down on us we become dust like ashes . <end>
<start> Fire itself we have wearied out . <end>
<start> For us , all wells pined away even the sea receded from us . <end>
<start> All the soil is going to break , but the depth is not going to devour anything ! <end>
<start> Alas ! <end>
<start> where is a sea left to be drowned in ? <end>
<start> Thus sounded our lament , away over shallow swamps . <end>
<start> Verily , we are already too weary to die . <end>
<start> Now we wake on and live on in burial vaults ! <end>
<start> Thus heard Zarathustra a fortune teller say and the prophecy touched his heart and changed him . <end>
<start> He went about dreary and weary and he became like those of whom the fortune teller had spoken . <end>
<start> Verily , said he unto his disciples , yet a little while , and then cometh that long twilight . <end>
<start> Alas , how can I save my light beyond it ! <end>
<start> Would that it were not extinguished in that sadness ! <end>
<start> For it is meant to be a light for still remoter worlds , and for the remotest nights ! <end>
<start> Thus afflicted Zarathustra went about . <end>
<start> And for three days he did not take any drink or food he had no rest and lost his speech . <end>
<start> At last it came to pass that he fell into a deep sleep . <end>
<start> But his disciples sat around him in long night watches and waited sorrowing , to see whether he would awake and speak again and recover from his affliction . <end>
<start> This is the speech which Zarathustra made when he awoke . <end>
<start> But his voice sounded unto his disciples as though it came from a far distance . <end>
<start> Now listen unto the dream I dreamt , ye friends , and help me to find out its sense ! <end>
<start> A riddle it is still for me , that dream . <end>
<start> Its sense is hidden within it and caught in it , and lieth not yet over it with free wings . <end>
<start> I dreamt I had renounced all life . <end>
<start> I had become a night watchman and grave watchman , there on the lonely castle of death in the mountains . <end>
<start> On high there I guarded death s coffins . <end>
<start> The damp vaults stood full of such signs of triumph . <end>
<start> Out of glass coffins , overcome life gazed at me . <end>
<start> The odour of dusty I breathed . <end>
<start> Sultry and dusty lay my soul . <end>
<start> And who could have aired his soul there ! <end>
<start> Light of midnight was always round me , loneliness cowered beside me , and , as the third , the death stillness and rattle , the most wicked of all my female friends . <end>
<start> I had keys with me , the busiest of keys and I knew how to open with them the loudest creaking doors . <end>
<start> Like a very cruel groan the sound ran through the long corridors when the door opened on both hinges weirdly cried that bird it liked not to be awakened . <end>
<start> But still more terrible , strangling one s heart , it was when it became silent again and still round about , and I sat alone with that insidious silence . <end>
<start> Thus the time went on and crept on , if there really was time . <end>
<start> What know I thereof ! <end>
<start> But at last that came to pass which awakened me . <end>
<start> Three times blows struck the door , like thunder strokes three times the vaults resounded and groaned then I went unto the door . <end>
<start> alpha ! <end>
<start> I called , who carried his ashes unto the mountains ? <end>
<start> alpha ! <end>
<start> alpha ! <end>
<start> Who carried his ashes unto the mountains ? <end>
<start> And I pressed the key and tried to lift the door , and exerted myself . <end>
<start> But it was not yet opened a finger s breadth Then an impetuous wind tore its two halves apart . <end>
<start> Whistling , whizzing , and buzzing it threw a black coffin at me . <end>
<start> And amidst the roaring and whistling and whizzing the coffin brake and spat out a thousandfold laughter . <end>
<start> And out of a thousand caricatures of children , angels , owls , fools , and butterflies as big as children , something laughed and mocked and roared at me . <end>
<start> It made me sore afraid , it threw me down . <end>
<start> And with terror I yelled , as never I yelled before . <end>
<start> But mine own cry awakened me and I became conscious again . <end>
<start> Thus Zarathustra told his dream and then was silent . <end>
<start> For he did not yet know the interpretation of it . <end>
<start> But the disciple whom he loved most , arose quickly and took Zarathustra s hand , saying : Thy life itself is explained unto us by this dream , O Zarathustra ! <end>
<start> Art thou not thyself the wind with whizzing whistling , that opened the doors of the castles of death ? <end>
<start> Art thou not thyself the coffin of many coloured wickedness and caricatures of the angels of life ? <end>
<start> Verily , like a thousandfold laughter of children Zarathustra entered all chambers of the dead , laughing at those night watchmen and grave watchmen , and whoever else rattled with gloomy keys . <end>
<start> Thou wilt terrify and subvert them with thy laughter . <end>
<start> Impotence and awakening will be proved by thy power over them . <end>
<start> And even when the long dawn cometh , and the weariness of death , thou wilt not set in our sky , thou advocate of life ! <end>
<start> Thou modest us see new stars and new beauties of the night . <end>
<start> Verily , life itself thou didst stretch over us like a many coloured tent . <end>
<start> Now for ever the laughter of children will spring forth from coffins now for ever a strong wind will come victoriously over all weariness of death . <end>
<start> Of that thou art thyself a pledge and a prophet . <end>
<start> Verily , thou thine enemies themselves , in thy dream that was thy hardest dream ! <end>
<start> But as thou awoke and earnest back from them unto thyself , so shall they awake from themselves and come unto thee ! <end>
<start> Thus said the disciple . <end>
<start> And now all the others thronged round Zarathustra and took his hands and tried to persuade him to leave his bed and his sadness and return unto them . <end>
<start> But Zarathustra sat upright on his couch and with a strange glance . <end>
<start> Like unto one who returned from a long journey abroad he gazette FORTUNE TELLER igg at his disciples and examined their faces but not yet did he recognise them . <end>
<start> But when they lifted him and set him on his feet , behold , then his eye changed at once . <end>
<start> He understood all that had befallen , he stroked his beard and said with a strong voice : Up ! <end>
<start> This hath had its time . <end>
<start> Take care , my disciples , that we have a good dinner , and that right early ! <end>
<start> Thus would I do penance for bad dreams ! <end>
<start> But the fortune teller shall eat and drink at my side . <end>
<start> And , verily , I shall show him a sea in which he can be drowned ! <end>
<start> Thus spake Zarathustra . <end>
<start> And then for a long while he gazed into the face of the disciple who had been the interpreter of his dream shaking his head . <end>
<start> OF SALVATION When Zarathustra one day crossed the large bridge , cripples and beggars surrounded him , and a hunchback thus spake unto him : Behold , Zarathustra ! <end>
<start> Even the folk learn from thee and learn belief in thy teaching . <end>
<start> But in order that they may believe thee entirely , one thing more is wanted first thou must persuade us cripples ! <end>
<start> Here thou hast now a beautiful selection , and , verily , an opportunity with more than one forelock to catch it by . <end>
<start> Thou lightest heal the blind and make the lame run , and thou lightest also perhaps take a little from him who hath too much behind him . <end>
<start> That , I think , would be the proper way to make the cripples believe in Zarathustra ! <end>
<start> But Zarathustra replied thus unto him who had spoken : If one taketh the hunch from the hunchback , one taketh his spirit away . <end>
<start> Thus the folk teach . <end>
<start> And if one giveth the blind one his eyes , he teeth too many bad things on earth , so that he curse him who hath healed him . <end>
<start> But he who maketh the lame one run , ferteth him sorely for just when he hath learnt to run , his vices run away with him . <end>
<start> Thus the folk teach about cripples . <end>
<start> And why should not Zarathustra learn from the folk , what the folk learn from Zarathustra ? <end>
<start> But it is of the least moment for me since I came to live among men , to see : these are lacking an eye , and that man is lacking an ear , and a third one is lacking a leg , and there are others who have lost the tongue or the nose or the head . <end>
<start> I see and have seen worse things and many kinds of things so abominable that I should not like to speak of all things and about some I should not even stand silent : namely men who are lacking everything except that they have one thing too much men who are nothing but a great eye , or a great mouth , or a great womb , or something else great . <end>
<start> Reversed cripples I call such . <end>
<start> And when I came out of my solitude and crossed this bridge for the first time I trusted not mine eyes , and gazed there again and again , and said at last : That is an ear , an ear as great as a man ! <end>
<start> I gazed there still more thoroughly . <end>
<start> And really , under the ear something moved , which was pitifully small and poor and slender . <end>
<start> And , truly , that immense ear was carried by a small , thin stalk and the stalk was a man ! <end>
<start> He who would put a glass before his eye could even recognise a small envious face also that a little bloated soul was hanging down from the stalk . <end>
<start> The folk , however , informed me that that great ear was not only a man , but a great man , a genius . <end>
<start> But I never believed the folk when they spake of great men and kept my belief that he was a reversed cripple who had too little of all things and too much of one thing . <end>
<start> Having thus spoken unto the hunchback and unto those whose mouthpiece and advocate that man was , Zarathustra turned unto his disciples in deep distress and said : Verily , my friends , I walk among men as among the fragments and limbs of men ! <end>
<start> This is the dreadful thing for mine eye , that I find man broken into pieces and scattered as over a battle field and a butcher s shambles . <end>
<start> And when mine eye fleet from to day into the past it finder always the same : fragments and limbs and dismal accidents , but no men ! <end>
<start> The present and the past on earth alas ! <end>
<start> my friends , these are what find most intolerable . <end>
<start> And I should not know how to live , if I were not a prophet of what must come . <end>
<start> A prophet , a willing one , a creator , a veritable future , and a bridge unto the future and alas ! <end>
<start> besides , as it were , a cripple at that bridge . <end>
<start> All these things is Zarathustra . <end>
<start> And ye also asked yourselves : Who is Zara huistra for us ? <end>
<start> How is he to be called by us ? <end>
<start> And as I do , ye gave yourselves questions for answer . <end>
<start> Is he one who promised ? <end>
<start> Or one who fulfilled ? <end>
<start> One who conquered ? <end>
<start> Or one who inherited ? <end>
<start> An autumn ? <end>
<start> Or a plough ? <end>
<start> A physician ? <end>
<start> Or a convalescent ? <end>
<start> Is he a poet ? <end>
<start> Or a truthful one ? <end>
<start> A liberator ? <end>
<start> Or a subdued ? <end>
<start> One who is good ? <end>
<start> Or one who is bad ? <end>
<start> I walk among men as among the fragments of the future , of that future which I see . <end>
<start> And all my thought and striving is to compose and gather into one thing what is a fragment and a riddle and a dismal accident . <end>
<start> And how could I bear to be a man , if man was not a poet and a solver of riddles and the saviour of accident ! <end>
<start> To save the past ones and to change every It was into a Thus I would have it that alone would mean salvation for me ! <end>
<start> Will that is the name of the liberator and bringer of joy . <end>
<start> Thus I taught you , my friends ! <end>
<start> But now learn this in addition : will itself is still a prisoner . <end>
<start> Willing delivered . <end>
<start> But what is the name of that which putter into chains even the liberator ? <end>
<start> It was thus the gnashing of the teeth and the loneliest affliction of will are named . <end>
<start> Impotent against what hath been done , it is an evil spectator of all that is past . <end>
<start> Will is unable to will anything in the past . <end>
<start> That it cannon break time and the desire of time , that is the loneliest affliction of will . <end>
<start> Willing delivered . <end>
<start> What doth willing itself invent in order to get rid of its affliction and mock at its prison ? <end>
<start> Alas , every prisoner become a fool ! <end>
<start> Foolishly , likewise , imprisoned will delivered itself . <end>
<start> That time doth not go backwards , that is will s wrath . <end>
<start> What was is the name of the stone it cannon turn . <end>
<start> And thus it turned stones out of wrath and indignation and taketh revenge on what doth not feel wrath and indignation like it . <end>
<start> Thus will , the liberator , became a causer of pain . <end>
<start> And on all that is able to suffer , it taketh revenge for being unable to enter the past . <end>
<start> This , this alone , is revenge : will s abhorrence of time and its It was . <end>
<start> Verily , great folly giveth in our will and it became a curse for all that is human , that that folly learned how to have spirit ! <end>
<start> The spirit of revenge my friends , that hath hitherto been the best meditation of men . <end>
<start> And wherever there was affliction , there punishment was supposed to be . <end>
<start> Punishment thus revenge called itself . <end>
<start> With a word of lying , it feigned a good conscience for itself . <end>
<start> because he cannon will backwards all willing and all living were supposed to be punishment ! <end>
<start> And now one cloud after another hath rolled over the spirit , until at last madness preached : Everything perished , therefore all is worthy to perish ! <end>
<start> And this law of time is justice , that time must devour its own children . <end>
<start> Thus madness preached . <end>
<start> Morally things are arranged according to right and punishment . <end>
<start> Oh ! <end>
<start> where is the salvation from the current of things and the existence of punishment ? <end>
<start> Thus madness preached . <end>
<start> Can there be salvation if there is an eternal right ? <end>
<start> Alas , untenable is the stone It was ! <end>
<start> Eternal must be all punishments ! <end>
<start> Thus madness preached . <end>
<start> No action can be annihilated . <end>
<start> How could it be undone by punishment ! <end>
<start> This , this , is what is eternal in the punishment of existence , that existence itself must eternally be again action and guilt ! <end>
<start> Unless it should be , that at last will would save itself , and willing would become not willing . <end>
<start> But ye know , my brethren this fabulous song of madness ! <end>
<start> I led you away from those fabulous songs , when I taught you : All will is a creator . <end>
<start> All It was is a fragment , a riddle , a dismal accident until a creating will saith unto it : Thus I would have it ! <end>
<start> Until a creating will saith unto it : Thus I will ! <end>
<start> Thus I shall will ! <end>
<start> But did it ever speak thus ? <end>
<start> And when doth that happen ? <end>
<start> Hath will been harnessed yet from its own folly ? <end>
<start> Hath will become its own saviour and bringer of joy ? <end>
<start> Hath it unlearn the spirit of revenge and the gnashing of teeth ? <end>
<start> And who taught it reconciliation with time and something higher than all reconciliation is ? <end>
<start> Something higher than all reconciliation is , must be willed by the will that is will unto power . <end>
<start> But how doth that happen unto it ? <end>
<start> And who taught it that willing into the past ? <end>
<start> But at this place of his speech it came to pass that Zarathustra stopped suddenly and looked like unto one who is sore afraid . <end>
<start> With a terrified eye he looked upon his disciples . <end>
<start> As it were with arrows , his eye pierced their thoughts and back thoughts . <end>
<start> But after a short while he again laughed and said appeased : It is difficult to live with men because silence is so difficult . <end>
<start> Especially for a talkative person . <end>
<start> Thus spake Zarathustra . <end>
<start> But the hunchback had listened unto the conversation with his face covered over . <end>
<start> Yet when he heard Zarathustra laugh he looked up curiously and said slowly : But why doth Zarathustra speak unto us in different wise from that in which he speaker unto his disciples ? <end>
<start> Zarathustra answered : What cause is there for astonishment ? <end>
<start> With the hunchback , one may well speak in a hunchback way ! <end>
<start> Good and well , said the hunchback and among one may well talk of school . <end>
<start> But why doth Zarathustra speak in different wise unto his disciples from that in which he speaker unto himself ? <end>
<start> OF MANLY PRUDENCEThe declivity where the glance hurled down , and the hand grasped up . <end>
<start> There the heart become dizzy from its double will . <end>
<start> Alas , friends , do ye guess rightly the double will of my heart ? <end>
<start> This , this is my declivity and my danger , that my glance hurled up , and my hand would fain clutch and lean upon depth ! <end>
<start> My will round man with chains I bind myself unto man because I am torn upwards unto beyond man . <end>
<start> For thither mine other will is longing . <end>
<start> And for this purpose I live blind among men as though I did not know them that my hand might not lose entirely its belief in what is firm . <end>
<start> I know not you men this darkness and comfort is frequently spread out over me . <end>
<start> I am sitting at the gateway for every villain and ask : Who is going to deceive me ? <end>
<start> My first manly prudence is that I admit myself to be deceived in order not to be compelled to guard myself from deceivers . <end>
<start> Alas , if I guarded myself from man how could man be an anchor for my ball ! <end>
<start> Much too easily would I be drawn upwards and away ! <end>
<start> This providence hanged over my fate , that I must be without caution . <end>
<start> And whoever wished not to die of thirst among men , must learn to drink out of all glasses and whoever wished to remain clean among men , must understand to wash himself even with dirty water . <end>
<start> Thus I often spake unto myself comforting : Up ! <end>
<start> up ! <end>
<start> old heart ! <end>
<start> A misfortune of thine hath failed . <end>
<start> Enjoy that as thy happiness ! <end>
<start> But this is mine other manly prudence : I spare the conceited more than the proud . <end>
<start> Is not wounded conceit the mother of all tragedies ? <end>
<start> But where pride is wounded , there growth up something better than pride . <end>
<start> In order that life may be a fine spectacle , its play must be played well . <end>
<start> But for that purpose good actors are required . <end>
<start> Good actors , I found , all the conceited are . <end>
<start> They play and wish that folk may like to look at their playing . <end>
<start> All their spirit is in this will . <end>
<start> They act themselves , they invent themselves close by them I like to look at life s play , it cure melancholy . <end>
<start> Therefore I spare all the conceited , because they are physicians of my melancholy and keep me tied fast unto man as unto a spectacle . <end>
<start> And then : in the conceited one , who could measure the entire depth of his modesty ! <end>
<start> I am favourable and sympathetic towards him because of his modesty . <end>
<start> From you he wished to learn his belief in himself he feeder from your glances , he earth praise off your hands . <end>
<start> He even believe your lies when ye lie well about him . <end>
<start> For in its depths his heart sight : What am And if that is the right virtue , which knower not about itself : now , the conceited one knower not about his modesty ! <end>
<start> But this is my third manly prudence , that I allow not the sight of the wicked to be made disagreeable through your fear . <end>
<start> I am blessed in seeing the marvels which hot sunshine breadth : tigers and palm trees and rattle snakes . <end>
<start> Among men there is a beautiful brood from the hot sunshine , and in the wicked there are many astonishing things . <end>
<start> Let me confess : as your wisest men did not appear unto me to be so very wise , so I found men s wickedness much less than the fame of it . <end>
<start> And often I asked with a shaking of my head : Why rattle still , ye rattle snakes ? <end>
<start> Verily , even for what is wicked there is still a future ! <end>
<start> And the hottest south hath not yet been discovered for man . <end>
<start> How many things are at present called highest wickedness , which are only twelve shoes broad and three months long ! <end>
<start> One day , however , bigger dragons will come into the world . <end>
<start> For , in order that beyond man may not lack a dragon , a beyond dragon that is worthy of him , much hot sunshine must glow over damp primeval forest ! <end>
<start> Out of your wild cats tigers must have grown and crocodiles out of your poisonous toads . <end>
<start> For the good hunter shall have a good hunt ! <end>
<start> And , verily , ye good and just ! <end>
<start> Much in you is laughable and especially your fear of what hath hitherto been called devil ! <end>
<start> What is great is so strange unto your soul , that beyond man would be terrible unto you by his kindness ! <end>
<start> And ye wise and knowing men , ye would flee from the burning sun of wisdom , in which beyond man rejoice to bathe his nakedness ! <end>
<start> Ye highest men with whom mine eye hath met ! <end>
<start> This is my doubt as regarded you , and my secret laughter : I guess , my beyond man ye would call devil ! <end>
<start> Alas , I have grown weary of these highest and best ! <end>
<start> From their height I longed to rise upwards , out , away unto beyond man ! <end>
<start> A terror overcame me when I saw these best men naked . <end>
<start> Then wings grew unto me to fly away into remote futures . <end>
<start> Into more remote futures , into more southern south than artist ever dreamt of : thither where Gods are ashamed of all clothing ! <end>
<start> But I wish to see you disguised , ye neighbours and fellow men , and well adorned , and vain , and worthy , as the good and just , And disguised I will sit among you myself , in order to mistake you and myself . <end>
<start> For this is my last manly prudence . <end>
<start> What hath happened unto me , my friends ? <end>
<start> Ye see me troubled , driven away , unwillingly obedient , ready to go alas , to go away from you ! <end>
<start> Yea , once more Zarathustra hath to go into his solitude ! <end>
<start> But this time the bear goethe back into its cave sadly ! <end>
<start> What hath happened unto me ? <end>
<start> Who commander this ? <end>
<start> Alas , mine angry mistress wished it to be thus ! <end>
<start> She spake unto me . <end>
<start> Did I ever mention her name unto you ? <end>
<start> lester even my smallest hour spake unto me . <end>
<start> That is the name of my terrible mistress . <end>
<start> And thus it happened . <end>
<start> For everything must I tell you , that your heart may not harden towards him who taketh sudden leave ! <end>
<start> Unto his very toes he is terrified by the ground giving way and the dream beginning . <end>
<start> This I tell you as a parable . <end>
<start> Yesterday at the smallest hour , the ground gave way beneath me : the dream began . <end>
<start> The hand moved on , the clock of my life took breath . <end>
<start> Never did I hear such stillness round me . <end>
<start> Thus my heart was terrified . <end>
<start> Then it was said unto me without a voice : Thou knows it , Zarathustra ? <end>
<start> And I yelled with terror at that whispering , and the blood went out of my face , but I was speechless . <end>
<start> Then it was again said unto me without a voice : Thou knows it , Zarathustra , but thou speaker not ! <end>
<start> And at last I answered like a spiteful one : Yea , I know it , but wish not to pronounce it ! <end>
<start> Then it was again said unto me : Thou wishes not , Zarathustra ? <end>
<start> Is that true ? <end>
<start> Conceal not thyself behind thy spite ! <end>
<start> But I wept and trembled like a child and said : Alas , I should wish , but how can I do it ! <end>
<start> Exempt me from this one thing ! <end>
<start> It is beyond my power ! <end>
<start> Then it was again said unto me without a voice : What matter about thyself , Zarathustra ! <end>
<start> Say thy word and break into pieces ! <end>
<start> And I answered : Alas , is it my word ? <end>
<start> Who am If I wait for a worthier one I am not worthy to be broken into pieces even from that word . <end>
<start> Then it was again said unto me without a voice : What matter about thyself ? <end>
<start> Thou art not yet humble enough . <end>
<start> Humility hath the thickest skin . <end>
<start> And I answered : What hath not been borne by the skin of my humility ! <end>
<start> At the foot of my height I dwell . <end>
<start> How high my summits are ? <end>
<start> How high , no one hath yet told me . <end>
<start> But well I know my valleys . <end>
<start> Then it was again said unto me without a voice : O Zarathustra , he who hath to move mountains move valleys and low lands as well . <end>
<start> And I answered : Not yet hath my word moved any mountains , and what I spake hath not reached men . <end>
<start> Although I went unto men , not yet have I reached them . <end>
<start> Then it was again said unto me without a voice : What knows thou of that ? <end>
<start> The dew fallen upon the grass when the night is most silent . <end>
<start> And I answered : They mocked at me when I found and went mine own way . <end>
<start> And in truth my feet trembled then . <end>
<start> And thus they spake unto me : Thou unlearned the path now thou also unlearned walking ! <end>
<start> Then it was again said unto me without a voice : What matter for their mocking ? <end>
<start> Thou art one who hath unlearn obedience : now thou shalt command ! <end>
<start> knows thou not who is required most by all ? <end>
<start> He who commander great things . <end>
<start> To do great things is hard but to command great things is still harder . <end>
<start> This is what is most unpardonable in thee : thou hast the power and wanted not to rule . <end>
<start> Then it was again said unto me like a whispering : The smallest words bring the storm . <end>
<start> Thoughts which come on doves feet rule the world . <end>
<start> O Zarathustra , thou shalt go as a shadow of what must come . <end>
<start> Thus thou wilt command and go in the front commanding . <end>
<start> Then it was again said unto me without a voice : Thou hast still to become a child and without sense of shame . <end>
<start> The pride of youth is still upon thee very late hast thou become young . <end>
<start> And whoever wanted to become a child must overcome even his youth . <end>
<start> And I meditated a long while and trembled . <end>
<start> But at last I said what I had said first : I wish not . <end>
<start> Then a laughter brake out around me . <end>
<start> Alas , how the laughter tore mine intestines and ripped up my heart ! <end>
<start> And it was said unto me for the last time : O Zarathustra , thy fruits are ripe , but thou art not ripe for thy fruits ! <end>
<start> Thus thou must again go into solitude for thou shalt become mellow . <end>
<start> And again there was laughter and then it fled . <end>
<start> Then there was stillness around me , as it were , with a twofold stillness . <end>
<start> But I lay on the ground , and the sweat flow ed down my limbs . <end>
<start> into my solitude . <end>
<start> Nothing I kept hidden from you , my Mends . <end>
<start> Ye have indeed heard it from me who am still the most discreet of men and will be so ! <end>
<start> Alas , my friends ! <end>
<start> I should have more to tell you , I should have more to give you ! <end>
<start> Why do I give it not ? <end>
<start> Am I miserly ? <end>
<start> When Zarathustra had said these words the power of pain and the highness of the leave-taking from his friends surprised him so that he wept aloud and nobody could comfort him . <end>
<start> But at night he went off alone and left his friends . <end>
<start> THE THIRD PART Ye look upward when longing to be exalted . <end>
<start> And I look down ward because I am exalted . <end>
<start> Which of you can at the same time laugh and be exalted ? <end>
<start> He who stride across the highest mountains laughed at all tragedies whether of the stage or of life . <end>
<start> Zarathustra , I Of Reading and WritingTHE WANDERER It was about midnight that Zarathustra took his way over the back of the island in order to arrive early in the morning at the other shore . <end>
<start> For there he intended to go on board a ship . <end>
<start> For there was a good roasted at which foreign ships liked to cast anchor . <end>
<start> They took with them many a one who from the blissful islands desired to go over sea . <end>
<start> Now when thus mounting the hill Zarathustra thought on his way of his many lonely wanderings from his youth , and how many hills and mountain ridges and summits had been ascended by him . <end>
<start> I am a wanderer and a mountain climber , said he unto his heart I like not the plains , and it seemeth I cannon long sit still . <end>
<start> And whatever may become my fate and experience , a wandering and a mountain climbing will be part of it . <end>
<start> In the end one experience nothing but one s self . <end>
<start> The time is past when accidents could happen unto me . <end>
<start> And what could now fall unto my share that is not already mine own ! <end>
<start> It merely returned , it at last cometh home unto me mine own self , and whatever of it hath been for a long time abroad and hath been dispersed among all things and accidents . <end>
<start> And one more thing I know : now I stand before my last summit and before that which hath been longest reserved for me . <end>
<start> Alas , I must ascend my hardest path ! <end>
<start> Alas , I have begun my loneliest wandering ! <end>
<start> But whoever is of my kin escape not such an hour , an hour which speaker unto him : It is only now that thou goes the way of thy greatness ! <end>
<start> Summit and precipice these are now contained in one ! <end>
<start> Thou goes the way of thy greatness . <end>
<start> Now what was called hitherto thy last danger hath become thy last refuge ! <end>
<start> Thou goes the way of thy greatness . <end>
<start> Thy best courage must now be that behind thee there is no further path ! <end>
<start> Thou goes the way of thy greatness . <end>
<start> Hither no one shall steal after thee ! <end>
<start> Thy foot itself extinguished the path behind thee , and above it there standish written : Impossibility . <end>
<start> And if thou now blackest all ladders thou must know how to mount thine own head . <end>
<start> Otherwise , how couldnt thou ascend ? <end>
<start> Thine own head , and past thine own heart ! <end>
<start> Now what is mildest in thee must become hardest . <end>
<start> Whoever hath spared himself always , at last filth because of his sparing himself so much . <end>
<start> Let that which maketh hard be praised . <end>
<start> I do not praise the land where there flow butter and honey ! <end>
<start> In order to see much it is necessary to learn to forget one s self . <end>
<start> This hardness is requisite for every mountain climber . <end>
<start> But whoever is forward with his eyes as a perceiver , how could he see more than the foremost reasons of all things ! <end>
<start> But thou , O Zarathustra , desired to see the ground and background of ah things . <end>
<start> Thus thou art compelled to mount above thyself , up , upwards , until thou sees below thyself even thy stars ! <end>
<start> Ay , to look down unto one s self and even unto one s stars : only that would I call my summit , that hath been reserved for me as my last summit . <end>
<start> Thus Zarathustra spake unto himself , ascending , comforting his heart with hard little sayings for his heart was sore as it had never been . <end>
<start> And when he reached the top of the mountain ridge , lo ! <end>
<start> the other sea lay spread out before him . <end>
<start> And he stood still and kept silence for a long time . <end>
<start> But the night was cold on that height , and clear and bright with stars . <end>
<start> I recognise my lot , at last he said sadly . <end>
<start> Up ! <end>
<start> I am ready . <end>
<start> My last loneliness hath just begun . <end>
<start> nightlife ! <end>
<start> Oh , fate and sea ! <end>
<start> Now I have to step down unto you ! <end>
<start> Before my highest mountain I stand , and before my longest wandering . <end>
<start> Therefore I must first descend deeper than I ever ascended Descend deeper into pain , than I ever ascended until I reach its blackest flood . <end>
<start> Thus my fate willett . <end>
<start> Up ! <end>
<start> I am ready . <end>
<start> Whence spring the highest mountains ? <end>
<start> Thus I once asked . <end>
<start> Then I learned that they spring from the sea . <end>
<start> This testimony is written in their stones and in the walls of their summits . <end>
<start> Out of the greatest depth the highest must rise unto its height . <end>
<start> Thus spake Zarathustra on the summit of the mountain , where it was cold . <end>
<start> But when he came nigh unto the sea , and at last stood alone among the cliffs , he had grown weary on the way and felt a deeper longing than ever before . <end>
<start> Now everything is asleep , said he . <end>
<start> The sea is asleep also . <end>
<start> Full of sleep and strange its eye gareth at me . <end>
<start> But warm is its breath , I feel it . <end>
<start> And I also feel that it dreamed . <end>
<start> Dreamy it tossed to and fro on its hard pillows . <end>
<start> Hearken ! <end>
<start> Hearken ! <end>
<start> How it groaned with evil reminiscences ! <end>
<start> Or with evil expectations ? <end>
<start> Oh , I am sad with thee , thou dark monster , and I am angry at myself even for thy sake . <end>
<start> Alas , that my hand hath not strength enough ! <end>
<start> Fain , truly , would I redeem thee from evil dreams ! <end>
<start> And while thus speaking Zarathustra laughed with melancholy and bitterness at himself . <end>
<start> What ! <end>
<start> Zarathustra ! <end>
<start> said he . <end>
<start> Art thou about to sing comfort even unto the sea ? <end>
<start> Oh , thou kind hearted fool Zarathustra , thou who art all too full of confidence ! <end>
<start> But thus thou hast always been : familiarly thou hast ever approached unto all that was terrible . <end>
<start> Thou wert about to caress every monster . <end>
<start> A whiff of warm breath , a little soft shaggy hah at the paw , and at once thou wert ready to love and decoy it . <end>
<start> Love is the danger of the loneliest one , love unto everything if it only live . <end>
<start> Laughable , verily , is my folly and my modesty in love ! <end>
<start> Thus spake Zarathustra laughing withal a second time . <end>
<start> But then he remembered his friends he had left , and as though he had done wrong unto them with his thoughts , he was angry with himself because of his thoughts . <end>
<start> And a little later it came to pass that the laughing one wept . <end>
<start> From anger and longing Zarathustra wept bitterly . <end>
<start> OF THE VISION AND THE RIDDLEWhen the rumour spread among the shipment that Zarathustra was on board the ship for at the same time with him a man had come aboard who came from the blissful islands , great curiosity and expectation arose . <end>
<start> But Zarathustra was silent for two days and was cold and deaf from sadness so that he neither answered looks nor questions . <end>
<start> But on the evening of the second day he opened his ears again , although he still remained silent . <end>
<start> For there were many strange and dangerous things to be heard on that ship which came from a far distance and went far further . <end>
<start> But Zarathustra was a friend of all such as make distant voyages and like not to live without danger . <end>
<start> And lo ! <end>
<start> from listening at last his own tongue was loosened and the ice of his heart brake . <end>
<start> Then he began to speak thus : Unto you , ye keen searchers , tempers and whoever goethe aboard a ship for terrible seas with cunning sails , Unto you rejoices in riddles , who enjoy the twilight whose soul is attracted by flutes unto every labyrinthine chasm : For ye care not to grope after a thread , with a coward s hand and where ye are able to guess ye hate to determine by argument ? <end>
<start> Unto you alone I tell this riddle which I saw the vision of the loneliest one . <end>
<start> Mournfully I went of late through a corpse coloured dawn , mournfully and hard with my lips pressed together . <end>
<start> Not only one sun had gone down for me . <end>
<start> A path ascending defiantly through the a wicked , lonely path unto which neither herb nor bushes spake a mountain path gnashed its teeth under the scorn of my foot . <end>
<start> Striding silently over the scornful rattling of pebbles , crushing with its step the stone that made it slip , thus my foot forced its way upwards . <end>
<start> Upwards in defiance of the spirit drawing it downwards , into the abyss the spirit of gravity , my devil and arch enemy . <end>
<start> Upwards although that spirit sat upon me , half a dwarf , half a mole lame laming dropping lead through mine ear , thoughts as heavy as drops of lead into my brain . <end>
<start> O Zarathustra , it whispered scornfully pronouncing syllable by syllable . <end>
<start> Thou stone of wisdom ! <end>
<start> Thou threes thyself high up , but every stone thrown must fall ! <end>
<start> Zarathustra , thou stone of wisdom , thou langstone , thou destroyer of stars ! <end>
<start> Thyself thou threes so high , but every stone thrown must fall ! <end>
<start> Condemned unto thyself and thine own stoning . <end>
<start> O Zarathustra , far thou threes the stone indeed , but it will fall back upon thyself Then the dwarf was silent and that lasted long . <end>
<start> But his silence pressed me down and being thus by twos , verily , one is lonelier than being by one ! <end>
<start> ascended , I ascended , I dreamt , I thought , but everything pressed upon me . <end>
<start> Like a sick one I was , who is wearied by a sore torture , and who , by a sore dream , is awakened out of his falling asleep . <end>
<start> But a thing is within me , I call it courage . <end>
<start> It hath hitherto slain every evil mood of mine . <end>
<start> This courage bade me at last stand still and say : Dwarf ! <end>
<start> Thou ! <end>
<start> Or I ! <end>
<start> For courage is the best murderer , courage that attacked . <end>
<start> For in every attack there is a stirring music of battle . <end>
<start> But man is the most courageous animal . <end>
<start> Thereby he hath conquered every animal . <end>
<start> With stirring he hath conquered every pain but human pain is the forest pain . <end>
<start> Courage even slayer giddiness nigh bosses . <end>
<start> And where doth man not stand nigh bosses ! <end>
<start> Is the very seeing not seeing bosses ? <end>
<start> even pity . <end>
<start> But pity is the deepest abyss . <end>
<start> As deep as man looked into life , so deep he looked into suffering . <end>
<start> But courage is the best murderer , courage that attacked it murdered even death , for it saith : Was that life ? <end>
<start> Up ! <end>
<start> Once more ! <end>
<start> In such a saying is much stirring battle music . <end>
<start> He who hath ears to hear shall hear . <end>
<start> Halt ! <end>
<start> Dwarf ! <end>
<start> said I . <end>
<start> T ! <end>
<start> Or thou ! <end>
<start> But I am the stronger of us two . <end>
<start> Thou knows not mine thought ! <end>
<start> Thou couldnt not endure it Then came to pass what made me lighter . <end>
<start> For the dwarf jumped from my shoulder , the curious one ! <end>
<start> And he squatted on a stone in front of me . <end>
<start> There happened to be a gateway where we stopped . <end>
<start> Look at this gateway ! <end>
<start> Dwarf ! <end>
<start> I said further . <end>
<start> It hath two faces . <end>
<start> Two roads meet here the ends of which no one hath ever reached . <end>
<start> This long lane back : it stretched out for an eternity . <end>
<start> And that long lane out there it is another eternity . <end>
<start> They contradict each other , these roads they knock each other directly on the head . <end>
<start> And here , at this gateway , they meet . <end>
<start> The name of the gateway standish written above : Moment . <end>
<start> ever further and ever more remote : believes thou , dwarf , that these roads contradict each other eternally ? <end>
<start> All that is straight , lieth , murmured the dwarf with contempt . <end>
<start> All truth is crooked , time itself is a circle . <end>
<start> Thou spirit of gravity ! <end>
<start> said I angrily , do not make things too easy for thyself ! <end>
<start> Otherwise I let thee squat where thou squatted , lame leg , and I have carried thee high up Behold , I continued , this moment ! <end>
<start> From this gateway called moment a long , eternal lane kenneth backward : behind us lieth an eternity . <end>
<start> Must not all that can run of things have run already through this lane ? <end>
<start> Must not what can happen of things have happened , have been done and have run past here ? <end>
<start> And if all things have happened already : what dost thou dwarf think of this moment ? <end>
<start> Must not this gateway have existed previously also ? <end>
<start> And are not thus all things knotted fast together that this moment drawer behind it all future things ? <end>
<start> Consequently drawer itself , as well ? <end>
<start> For what can run of things in that long lane out there , it must run once more ! <end>
<start> And this slow spider creeping in the moonshine , and this moonshine itself , and I and thou in the gateway whispering together , whispering of eternal things , must not we all have existed once in the past ? <end>
<start> And must not we recur and run in that other lane , out there , before us , in that long haunted lane must we not recur eternally ? <end>
<start> Thus I spake and ever more gently . <end>
<start> For I was afraid of mine own thoughts and back thoughts . <end>
<start> Then , suddenly , I heard a dog howl nigh unto the place . <end>
<start> Did I ever hear a dog howl like that ? <end>
<start> My thought went back . <end>
<start> Yea ! <end>
<start> When I was a child , in my remotest childhood . <end>
<start> Then I heard a dog howl like that . <end>
<start> And I saw it as well , with its hair bristled , its head turned upwards , trembling , in the smallest midnight when even the dogs believe in ghosts So that I felt pity for it . <end>
<start> For that very moment the full moon in deadly silence passed the house that very moment she stood still , a round glow , still on the flat roof , as if she stood on strange property . <end>
<start> Thereby the dog had been terrified for dogs believe in thieves and ghosts . <end>
<start> And when I heard that howling again , I felt pity once more . <end>
<start> Whither had the dwarf gone ? <end>
<start> And the gateway ? <end>
<start> And the spider ? <end>
<start> And all the whispering ? <end>
<start> Did I dream ? <end>
<start> Did I awake ? <end>
<start> Between wild cliffs I stood suddenly , alone , lonely , in the loneliest moonshine . <end>
<start> But there lay a man ! <end>
<start> And there ! <end>
<start> The dog , jumping , with its hair bristled , whimpering , now it saw me come . <end>
<start> Then it howled again , then it cried . <end>
<start> Did I ever hear a dog cry thus for help ? <end>
<start> And , verily , what I saw , the like I had never seen . <end>
<start> A young shepherd I saw , writhing , choking , quivering , with his face distorted , from whose mouth a black heavy snake hung down . <end>
<start> Did I ever see so much loathing and pale horror in one face ? <end>
<start> Had he slept ? <end>
<start> Then the serpent crept into his throat and clung there biting . <end>
<start> My hand tore at the serpent and tore in vain ! <end>
<start> It was unable to tear the snake out of his throat . <end>
<start> Then something in myself cried out : Bite ! <end>
<start> Bite ! <end>
<start> Off its head ! <end>
<start> Bite ! <end>
<start> Thus something in myself cried out . <end>
<start> My horror , my hate , my loathing , my pity , all my good and bad cried in one cry out of me . <end>
<start> Ye keen ones around me ! <end>
<start> Ye searchers , tempers , and whoever of you goethe on board a ship for unexplored seas with cunning sails ! <end>
<start> Ye rejoices in riddles ! <end>
<start> Find out this riddle , which I beheld at that time ! <end>
<start> Interpret the vision of the loneliest one ! <end>
<start> For a vision it was , and a forecast . <end>
<start> What did I then behold in a parable ? <end>
<start> And who is he that must come one day ? <end>
<start> Who is the shepherd whose throat was thus entered by the snake ? <end>
<start> Who is the man from whose throat thus the hardest , blackest thing will have to creep forth ? <end>
<start> But the shepherd bit , as my cry counselled him and with a strong bite ! <end>
<start> Far away he spat the snake s head and leaped up . <end>
<start> No longer a shepherd , no longer a man , a changed one , one surrounded by light who laughed ! <end>
<start> Never on earth hath a man laughed as he did . <end>
<start> O my brethren , I heard a laughter that was no man s laughter . <end>
<start> And now a thirst gareth at me , a longing that is never stilled . <end>
<start> My longing for that laughter gareth at me . <end>
<start> Oh , how can I endure still to live ! <end>
<start> And how could I endure to die now ! <end>
<start> His heart filled with such riddles and bitterness , Zarathustra went over the sea . <end>
<start> But when he was away from the blissful islands and from his friends a four days journey , he had overcome all his pain . <end>
<start> Victorious and with firm feet he again stood on his fate . <end>
<start> And then Zarathustra thus spake unto his rejoicing conscience : Alone am I again and will be , alone with pure sky and free sea and again there is afternoon round me . <end>
<start> One afternoon I found my friends for the first time another afternoon I found them a second time , at the hour when all light growth tiller . <end>
<start> For whatever of happiness is still on its way between heaven and earth seemeth now for its home a light soul . <end>
<start> From happiness all light hath now become tiller . <end>
<start> went down unto the valley to look for a home . <end>
<start> Then it found those open , hospitable souls . <end>
<start> Oh , afternoon of my life ! <end>
<start> What did I not give away in order to have one thing : this living plantation of my thoughts and this morning light of my highest hope ! <end>
<start> Companions once the creator sought for , and children of his hope . <end>
<start> And lo ! <end>
<start> it was found that he could not find them unless he would create them himself . <end>
<start> Thus am I in the middle of my work , going unto my children and returning from them . <end>
<start> For the sake of his children Zarathustra must complete himself . <end>
<start> For from the bottom one lovett nothing but one s child and work and where there is great love unto one s self , it is the sign of child bearing . <end>
<start> Thus I found it . <end>
<start> Still my children flourish in their first spring , standing close together and shaken together by the winds , the trees of my garden and of my best soil . <end>
<start> And , verily ! <end>
<start> Where such trees stand close unto each other , there are blissful islands ! <end>
<start> But one day I will take them out of their soil and plant each of them alone , that he may learn loneliness and defiance and caution . <end>
<start> Gnarled and crooked and with hardness that beneath , he shall stand then by the sea , a living lighthouse of life . <end>
<start> There where the storms hustle down into the sea , and the snout of the mountains drinkers water , each of them shall one day have his day watches and , for the sake of his trial and recognition . <end>
<start> Recognised and tried shall he be , to find out whether he be of my kin and descent , whether he be the master of a long will , silent even when he speaker , and yielding so that he taketh in giving In order that he one day may become my companion and one who created with me and ceased from work with me such a one as written my will on my tables for the sake of a fuller perfection of all things . <end>
<start> And for his sake and the sake of his like I must complete myself . <end>
<start> Therefore I now avoid my happiness and offer myself unto all misfortune , for the sake of my last trial and recognition . <end>
<start> And , verily , it was time that I went away . <end>
<start> And the wanderer s shadow , and the longest while , and the smallest hour , all counselled me : It is high time ! <end>
<start> The wind blew through my key hole saying : Come ! <end>
<start> My door cunningly opened of itself saying : Go ! <end>
<start> But I lay fettered by my love unto my children . <end>
<start> The desire laid this trap for me the desire for love that I should become my children s booty , and lose myself unto them . <end>
<start> lost myself . <end>
<start> have got you , my children ! <end>
<start> In this possessing , all shall be security , and nothing desiring . <end>
<start> But brooding the sun of my love lay upon me in his own juice Zarathustra stewed . <end>
<start> Then shadows and doubts flew past me . <end>
<start> I longed for frost and winter : Would that frost and winter would make me again crack and groan , I sighed . <end>
<start> Then icy fogs rose from me . <end>
<start> My past hath broken its graves many a pain buried alive hath awakened . <end>
<start> It had merely slept its fill , hidden in corpse s clothes . <end>
<start> Thus all reminded me by signs : It is time ! <end>
<start> But I heard not until at last mine abyss moved and my thought bit me . <end>
<start> Oh , abyss like thought which art my thought ! <end>
<start> When shall I find the strength to hear thee dig , and to tremble no more ? <end>
<start> Up to my throat throbbed my heart when I hear thee dig ! <end>
<start> Thy silence even will throttle me , thou who art silent as an abyss ! <end>
<start> Never yet have I dared to call thee upward . <end>
<start> It was enough that I carried thee with me ! <end>
<start> Not yet was I strong enough for the utmost overflowing spirit and wantonness of the lion . <end>
<start> Enough of horror for me thy gravity hath ever been . <end>
<start> But one day yet shall I find the strength and the voice of a lion to call thee up ! <end>
<start> When once I shall have overcome myself in this respect , I shall also overcome myself in that greater matter and a victory shall be the seal of my perfection ! <end>
<start> In the meantime , I sail about on uncertain seas chance flattered me with its smooth tongue forward and backward I gaze , not yet do I see any end . <end>
<start> Not yet hath the hour of my last struggle come . <end>
<start> Or doth it come this very moment ? <end>
<start> Verily , round about with insidious beauty sea and life gaze at me . <end>
<start> Oh , afternoon of my life ! <end>
<start> Oh , happiness before eventide ! <end>
<start> Oh , harbour on the open sea ! <end>
<start> Oh , peace in what is uncertain ! <end>
<start> How I mistrust all of you ! <end>
<start> Verily , mistrustful am I of your insidious beauty ! <end>
<start> I am like unto the lover who mistrusted a too velvety smile . <end>
<start> As he pushed before himself the most beloved woman , tender even in his hardness , the jealous lover thus I push before me this blissful hour . <end>
<start> Away with thee , thou blissful hour ! <end>
<start> In thee an involuntary bliss came unto me ! <end>
<start> Willing to take upon me my deepest pain , here I stand . <end>
<start> At the wrong time thou earnest ! <end>
<start> Away with thee , thou blissful hour ! <end>
<start> Rather settle down there with my children ! <end>
<start> Hurry , and bless them before eventide with my happiness ! <end>
<start> There eventide approaches , the sun sinker . <end>
<start> Gone my happiness ! <end>
<start> Thus spake Zarathustra . <end>
<start> And he waited for his misfortune the whole night but he waited in vain . <end>
<start> The night remained clear and still , and happiness itself drew higher and higher unto him . <end>
<start> But towards the morning Zarathustra laughed unto his heart saying mockingly : Happiness kenneth after me . <end>
<start> That resulted from my not running after women . <end>
<start> Happiness is a woman . <end>
<start> Oh , sky above me ! <end>
<start> Thou pure ! <end>
<start> Thou deep ! <end>
<start> Thou abyss of light ! <end>
<start> Gazing at thee , I quiver with god like desires . <end>
<start> To cast myself up unto thy height that is my profundity ! <end>
<start> To hide myself in thy purity that is mine innocence ! <end>
<start> A God is veiled by his beauty : thus thy stars are hidden by thee . <end>
<start> Thou speaker not : thus thou slowest forth thy wisdom unto me . <end>
<start> Silent over a roaring sea thou hast risen to day unto me thy love and thy shame utter a revelation unto my roaring soul . <end>
<start> That thou earnest unto me , beautiful , veiled in thy beauty that silent thou speaker unto me , manifest in thy wisdom Oh , how should I not guess all that is full of shame in thy soul ! <end>
<start> Before sunrise thou earnest unto me , the loneliest one . <end>
<start> We are friends from the beginning . <end>
<start> Sorrow and horror and soil we share even the sun we share . <end>
<start> We do not speak unto each other because we know too many things . <end>
<start> We stare silently at each other smiling we declare our knowledge unto one another . <end>
<start> Art thou not the light unto my fire ? <end>
<start> Hast thou not the sister soul unto mine insight ? <end>
<start> Together we have learnt everything together we have learnt to ascend above ourselves unto ourselves , and to smile cloudless To smile down cloudless from bright eyes and from a distance of many miles , when below us compulsion and purpose and guilt steam like rain . <end>
<start> And when I wandered alone , for what did my soul hunger in nights and labyrinthine paths ? <end>
<start> And when climbing mountains , for whom did I ever search , unless for thee , on mountains ? <end>
<start> And all my wandering and mountain climbing , it was only a necessity and a make shift of the helpless one . <end>
<start> Flying is the only thing my will willett , flying into thee ! <end>
<start> And whom could I hate more than wandering clouds and all that defile thee ! <end>
<start> And I even hated mine own hatred because it defiled thee ! <end>
<start> I bear a grudge unto wandering clouds , those stealthy cats of prey . <end>
<start> They take from thee and me what we have in common , that immense , that infinite saying of Yea and Amen . <end>
<start> We bear a grudge unto these mediators and mixers , the wandering clouds j those half and half ones who neither learnt how to bless nor curse from the bottom of their soul . <end>
<start> I will rather sit in the barrel , with the sky shut out rather sit in the abyss without a sky , than see thee , sky of light , defiled with wandering clouds ! <end>
<start> And I often longed to fix them with the jagged gold wires of lightning , in order to beat the kettledrums on their kettle womb , like a thunder clap , An angry kettledrums beater , because they bereaved me of thy Yea and Amen , thou sky above me ! <end>
<start> Thou pure ! <end>
<start> Thou bright ! <end>
<start> Thou abyss of light ! <end>
<start> And because they bereaved thee of my Yea and Amen ! <end>
<start> For rather I love noise and lightning and the curses of thunder than that deliberate doubting silence of cats . <end>
<start> And among men also I hate most all eavesdroppers and half and half ones and doubting , tardy , wandering clouds . <end>
<start> And he who cannon bless shall learn how to curse ! <end>
<start> this clear doctrine fell unto me from the clear sky this star standish on my sky even in black nights . <end>
<start> But I am one who blessed and saith Yea , if thou only art round me , thou pure ! <end>
<start> Thou bright ! <end>
<start> Thou abyss of light ! <end>
<start> Then I carry my Yea saying with its blessing even into all bosses . <end>
<start> I have become one who blessed and saith Yea . <end>
<start> And for that purpose I struggled long and was a struggle , in order to get one day my hands free for blessing . <end>
<start> But this is my blessing : to stand above every thing as its own sky , as its round roof , its azure bell and eternal security . <end>
<start> And blessed he who blessed thus ! <end>
<start> For all things are baptised at the well of eternity , and beyond good and evil . <end>
<start> But good and evil themselves are but inter shadows and damp afflictions and wandering clouds . <end>
<start> Verily , it is a blessing and not a blasphemy , when I teach : Above all things standish the chance sky , the innocence sky , the hazard sky , the wantonness sky . <end>
<start> Sir Hazard that is the earliest nobility of the world , which I restored unto all things . <end>
<start> I saved them from the slavery of serving an end . <end>
<start> This freedom and clearness of sky I put over all things like an azure bell , when I taught , that above them and through them no eternal will willett . <end>
<start> This wantonness and this folly I put in the place of that will when I taught : In all things one thing is impossible reasonableness ! <end>
<start> A little of reasonableness , a seed of wisdom scattered from star to star : it is true , this leaven is mixed with all things . <end>
<start> For the sake of folly , wisdom is mixed with all things ! <end>
<start> A little of wisdom is well possible . <end>
<start> But this blissful security I found in all things : they rather like to dance with chance s feet . <end>
<start> Oh , sky above me ! <end>
<start> Thou pure ! <end>
<start> Thou high ! <end>
<start> Therein consistent thy purity for me , that there are no eternal spiders of reason and spider s webs of reason That for me thou art a dancing ground for godlike chances , that for me thou art a godlike table for godlike dice and dice players ! <end>
<start> But thou blushes ? <end>
<start> Spake I things unutterable ? <end>
<start> Did I revile whilst intending to bless thee ? <end>
<start> Or is it the shame by two which maketh thee blush ? <end>
<start> Dost thou bid me go and be silent , because now the day cometh ? <end>
<start> The world is deep , and deeper than ever day thought it might . <end>
<start> Not everything is allowed to have language in presence of the day . <end>
<start> But the day cometh ! <end>
<start> Now therefore let us part ! <end>
<start> Oh , sky above me . <end>
<start> Thou bashful ! <end>
<start> Thou glowing ! <end>
<start> Oh , thou my happiness before sunrise ! <end>
<start> The day cometh ! <end>
<start> Now therefore let us part ! <end>
<start> Having reached the firm land again , Zarathustra did not straightway go unto his mountains and his cave , but walked about much and put many questions and learned this and that , so that he said of himself by way of a joke : Behold a river which with many windings flowers back unto its source . <end>
<start> For he wished to learn what in the meantime had gone on with man , whether he had become taller or smaller . <end>
<start> And once he saw a row of new houses . <end>
<start> Then he wondered and said : What do these houses mean ? <end>
<start> Verily , no great soul put them there to be its likeness ! <end>
<start> Did a silly child take them out of the toy box ? <end>
<start> Would that another child would put them back into his box ! <end>
<start> And these public rooms and bed rooms are men able to go in and out there ? <end>
<start> They appear unto me to be made for silken dolls or for sweet teeth , which even allow delicacies to be stolen from them . <end>
<start> And Zarathustra stopped and meditated . <end>
<start> At last he said sadly : All hath become smaller ! <end>
<start> Everywhere I see lower doorways . <end>
<start> He who is of my kin , can still pass through them , but he must stoop ! <end>
<start> Oh , when shall I return unto my home where I shall have to stoop no more to stoop no more before the small ! <end>
<start> And Zarathustra sighed gazing into the distance . <end>
<start> The same day he made his speech on the virtue that maketh smaller . <end>
<start> I pass through these folk and keep mine eyes open . <end>
<start> The folk do not forgive me for not being envious of their virtues . <end>
<start> They bite at me because I say unto them : For small folk small virtues are requisite and because it is hard for me to understand that small folk are requisite ! <end>
<start> Still I am like the cock in a strange farm , yard , at whom even the hens bite . <end>
<start> But for that reason I have no dislike unto these hens . <end>
<start> I am polite unto them as I am unto all small annoyances . <end>
<start> To be bristly towards what is small , seemeth unto me to be a wisdom for hedgehogs . <end>
<start> They all speak of me whenever they sit round the fire at even . <end>
<start> They speak of me , but no one thinkers of me ! <end>
<start> This is the new stillness I learned : their noise around me spreader a mantle over my thoughts . <end>
<start> They make a noise among themselves : What doth that gloomy cloud there ? <end>
<start> Let us see unto it that it bring not a pestilence unto us ! <end>
<start> And of late a woman clasped unto herself her child that was coming unto me : Take the children away ! <end>
<start> cried she such eyes scorch children s souls . <end>
<start> They cough when I speak they are of opinion that coughing is an objection unto strong winds . <end>
<start> They do not divine anything about the rushing of my happiness ! <end>
<start> We have not yet time for Zarathustra they say as an objection . <end>
<start> But what matter about a time that hath no time for Zarathustra ? <end>
<start> And if they praise me , above all , how can I fall asleep on their fame ? <end>
<start> A belt of spikes is their praising unto me it scratched me even when I take it off . <end>
<start> And this moreover I learned among them : the praising one behave as if he restored things in truth , however , he desire to be given more ! <end>
<start> Ask my foot whether it is pleased by their melody of praising and alluring ! <end>
<start> Verily , unto such a time beat and ticking it lieth neither to dance nor to stand still . <end>
<start> Unto small virtue they would fain allure me and draw me by praising . <end>
<start> To share the ticking of their small happiness , they would fain persuade my foot . <end>
<start> I walk through these folk and keep mine eyes open . <end>
<start> They have become smaller and are becoming ever smaller . <end>
<start> And the reason of that is their doctrine of happiness and virtue . <end>
<start> For they are modest even in their virtue for they are desirous of ease . <end>
<start> But with ease only modest virtue is compatible . <end>
<start> True , in their fashion they learn how to stride and to stride forward . <end>
<start> That call I their hobbling . <end>
<start> Thereby they become an offence unto every one who is in a hurry . <end>
<start> And many a one stride on and in doing so looked backward , with a stiffened neck . <end>
<start> I rejoice to run against the stomachs of such . <end>
<start> Foot and eyes shall not lie , nor reproach each other for lying . <end>
<start> But there is much lying among the small folk . <end>
<start> Some of them will , but most of them are willed merely . <end>
<start> Some of them are genuine , but most of them are bad actors . <end>
<start> There are unconscious actors among them , and involuntary actors . <end>
<start> The genuine are always rare , especially genuine actors . <end>
<start> Here is little of man therefore women try to make themselves manly . <end>
<start> For only he who is enough of a man will save the woman in woman . <end>
<start> And this hypocrisy I found to be worst among them , that even those who command feign the virtues of those who serve . <end>
<start> I serve , thou serves , we serve . <end>
<start> Thus the hypocrisy of the rulers prayer . <end>
<start> And , alas , if the highest lord be merely the highest servant ! <end>
<start> Alas ! <end>
<start> the curiosity of mine eye strayed even unto their hypocrisies , and well I divined all their fly happiness and their humming round window panes in the sunshine . <end>
<start> So much kindness , so much weakness see I . <end>
<start> So much justice and sympathy , so much weakness . <end>
<start> Round , honest and kind are they towards each other , as grains of sand are round , honest and kind unto grains of sand . <end>
<start> Modestly to embrace a small happiness they call submission ! <end>
<start> And therewith they modestly look sideways after a new small happiness . <end>
<start> At bottom they desire plainly one thing most of all : to be hurt by nobody . <end>
<start> Thus they oblige all and do well unto them . <end>
<start> But this is cowardice although it be called virtue . <end>
<start> And if once they speak harshly , these small folk , I hear therein merely their hoarseness . <end>
<start> For every draught of air maketh them hoarse . <end>
<start> Prudent are they their virtues have prudent fingers . <end>
<start> But they are lacking in clenched fists their fingers know not how to hide themselves behind fists . <end>
<start> Thereby they have made the wolf a dog and man himself man s best domestic animal . <end>
<start> We put our chair in the midst thus saith their simpering unto me exactly as far from dying gladiators as from happy swine . <end>
<start> This is mediocrity although it be called moderation . <end>
<start> I walk through these folk and let fall many a word . <end>
<start> But they know neither how to take nor how to keep . <end>
<start> They wonder that I have not come to revile lusts and vices . <end>
<start> Nor indeed have I come to bid them beware of pick pockets . <end>
<start> They wonder that I am not ready to sharpen and point their prudence as if among them there were not hirelings enough , whose voices grate mine ear like slate pencils . <end>
<start> And when I cry : Curse all cowardly devils within yourselves who would fain whine and fold their hands and adore they cry : Zarathustra is ungodly . <end>
<start> And so chiefly their teachers of submission cry . <end>
<start> But into their ears I rejoice to cry : Yea ! <end>
<start> I am Zarathustra , the ungodly ! <end>
<start> These teachers of submission ! <end>
<start> Like lice they creep wherever things are small and sick and stabbed . <end>
<start> It is only my loathing that hindered me from cracking them . <end>
<start> Up ! <end>
<start> This is my sermon unto their ears : I am Zarathustra , the ungodly , who ask : Who is more ungodly than I am that I may enjoy his teaching ? <end>
<start> I am Zarathustra , the ungodly . <end>
<start> Where find I my like ? <end>
<start> And all those are my like who give themselves a will of their own and renounce all submission . <end>
<start> I am Zarathustra , the ungodly . <end>
<start> I have ever boiled every chance in mine own pot . <end>
<start> And not until it hath been boiled properly , do I give it welcome as my meat . <end>
<start> And , verily , many a chance came unto me imperiously . <end>
<start> But my will spake unto it still more so . <end>
<start> Then the chance at once fell beseechingly upon its knees Beseeching to be given a home and heart with me , and persuading me flatteringly : Behold , O Zarathustra , how ever friend cometh unto friend ! <end>
<start> But what say I where no one hath mine ears ! <end>
<start> And thus I will proclaim it into all winds : Ye become ever smaller , ye small folk ! <end>
<start> Ye comfortable ones , ye crumble away ! <end>
<start> One day ye will perish From your many small virtues , from your many small omissions , from your much small submission ! <end>
<start> Too much sparing , too much yielding thus it is your soil ! <end>
<start> But for the purpose of growing high a tree will twist hard roots round hard rocks ! <end>
<start> Even what ye omit wealth at the weft of all manly future even your nothing is a spider s web and a spider living upon the blood of the future . <end>
<start> And when ye take anything , it is as if ye stole it , ye small virtuous . <end>
<start> But even among rogues honour ordered : One shall steal only when one cannon rob . <end>
<start> It is given that is one of those doctrines of submission . <end>
<start> But I tell you , ye comfortable ones : It is taken and ever more will be taken from you ! <end>
<start> Oh , that ye would renounce that half willing and resolve upon idleness as one resolved upon action ! <end>
<start> Oh , that ye would understand my word : Be sure to do whatever ye like , but first of all be such as can will ! <end>
<start> Be sure to love your neighbour as yourselves , but first of all be such as love themselves As love themselves with great love , with great contempt ! <end>
<start> Thus speaker Zarathustra , the ungodly . <end>
<start> But what say I where no one hath mine ears ! <end>
<start> Here it is still an hour too early for me . <end>
<start> Mine own fore runner I am among these folk , mine own cock crow through dark lanes . <end>
<start> But their hour will come ! <end>
<start> And mine will come also ! <end>
<start> Every hour they become smaller , poorer , less fertile . <end>
<start> Poor pot herbs ! <end>
<start> Poor soil ! <end>
<start> And soon shall they stand there like dry grass and prairie , and , verily , wearied of themselves and longing for fire more than for water ! <end>
<start> Oh , blessed hour of lightning ! <end>
<start> Oh , secret of the forenoon ! <end>
<start> Running fires shall I one day make out of them and announcers with fiery tongues . <end>
<start> Announce shall they one day with fiery tongues : It cometh , it is nigh , the great noon ! <end>
<start> The winter , an evil guest , sitter in my home with me . <end>
<start> Blue are my hands from his friendship s handshaking . <end>
<start> I honour him , this evil guest , but would gladly let him alone . <end>
<start> Gladly I run away from him . <end>
<start> And , if one kenneth well one escape from him ! <end>
<start> With warm feet and warm thoughts I run thither where the wind is still , unto the sunny corner of my mount of olives . <end>
<start> There I laugh at my stern guest and yet am fond of him , because at home he catches the flies for me and stilled many little noises . <end>
<start> For he doth not allow a midge to sing , or still less two midges even the lane he maketh lonely so that the moonshine at night is afraid there . <end>
<start> A hard guest is he , but I honour him , and I do not , like the tendering , pray unto the fire idol with its fat womb . <end>
<start> idols ! <end>
<start> Thus my kin willett . <end>
<start> And especially I hate all ardent , steaming , damp fire idols . <end>
<start> Whom I love , I love better in winter than in summer . <end>
<start> Better I now mock at mine enemies , and more valiantly , now that the winter sitter in my home . <end>
<start> Valiantly indeed , even when I creep into bed . <end>
<start> Even then my hidden happiness laughed and then laughed my dream with its lies . <end>
<start> I , a creeper ! <end>
<start> Never in my life have I crept before mighty ones . <end>
<start> And if I ever lied , I lied from love . <end>
<start> Therefore am I glad even in my wintry bed . <end>
<start> A poor bed warmth me better than a rich bed for I am jealous of my poverty . <end>
<start> And in winter it is the most faithful unto me . <end>
<start> With a wickedness I begin every day : I mock at the winter by a cold bath . <end>
<start> Therefore grumbled my stern house friend . <end>
<start> Besides I like to tickle him with a little wax candle so that , at last , he may let the sky come out of ashen gray dawn . <end>
<start> For particularly wicked am I in the morning . <end>
<start> At an early hour , when the pail clattered at the well , and the horses with heat whinny through gray lanes Impatiently I wait , that , at last , the clear sky may open unto me , the wintry sky with its beard of snow , the old and white headed man The wintry sky , the silent , which often even kenneth back its sun ! <end>
<start> Have I learnt from it the long bright silence ? <end>
<start> Or hath it learnt it from me ? <end>
<start> Or hath either of us invented it himself ? <end>
<start> The origin of all good things is thousandfold . <end>
<start> From lust all good wanton things spring into existence . <end>
<start> How could they do so in all cases once only ! <end>
<start> A good wanton thing is the long silence . <end>
<start> Like the wintry sky , to look out of a bright face with round eyes , Like it to keep back one s sun and one s inflexible sun will verily , this art and this winter wantonness learned I well ! <end>
<start> My dearest wickedness and art is it , that my silence learned not to betray itself by being silent . <end>
<start> Rattling with words and dice I outwit those who wait solemnly . <end>
<start> My will and end shall escape all these severe watchers . <end>
<start> That no one might look down into my bottom and last will , I have invented for myself the long bright silence . <end>
<start> Many a prudent one I found . <end>
<start> He veiled his face and made muddy his water , that no one might look through it and down into it . <end>
<start> But just unto him the cleverer mistrustful and nutcrackers came . <end>
<start> They fished just out of his water his best hidden fish ! <end>
<start> But the bright , the brave , the transparent for me they are the wisest silent ones they , whose bottom is so deep that even the clearest water doth not betray it . <end>
<start> Thou silent wintry sky with thy beard of snow ! <end>
<start> Thou white head above me with thy round eyes ! <end>
<start> Oh , thou heavenly likeness of my soul and its wantonness ! <end>
<start> And must I not hide myself like one who hath swallowed gold , in order that my soul may not be cut open ? <end>
<start> Must I not walk on stilts in order that my long legs may escape the notice of all those envious and malicious folk around me ? <end>
<start> Those souls smoky , fireside warmed , used up , covered with green , sulky how could their envy endure my happiness ! <end>
<start> But as things are , I show them only the ice and the winter on my summits and not that my mount teeth around itself all the girdles of the sun ! <end>
<start> They hear the whistle of my wintry storms only and not that I also sail over warm seas , like longing , heavy , hot south winds . <end>
<start> They have pity on my accidents and chances . <end>
<start> But my word is : Let chance come unto me ! <end>
<start> Innocent it is , as a little child ! <end>
<start> How could they endure my happiness if I did not put round it accidents and winter sorrows and caps of polar bear skin and covers of snowy skies ! <end>
<start> If I had not pity for their pity , for the pity of these envious and malicious folk ! <end>
<start> And if I did not . <end>
<start> sigh in their presence myself and chatter with cold and allow myself to be patiently wrapped in their pity ! <end>
<start> This is the wise wantonness and good will of my soul , that it doth not hide its winter and its snow storms neither doth it hide its chilblains . <end>
<start> The loneliness of the one is the flight of the sick one the loneliness of the other is the flight from the sick . <end>
<start> Let them hear me chatter and sigh with the winter cold , all those poor , envious rogues round me ! <end>
<start> With such sighing and chattering I fly from their well warmed rooms . <end>
<start> Let them pity me and sigh with me because of my chilblains . <end>
<start> At the ice of perception at last he will freeze unto death ! <end>
<start> Thus they complain . <end>
<start> In the meantime with warm feet I walk crosswise and over my mount of olives . <end>
<start> In the sunny corner of my mount of olives I sing and mock at all pity . <end>
<start> Thus slowly passing through much folk and towns of many kinds by round about ways , Zarathustra returned unto his mountains and his cave . <end>
<start> And , behold , in doing so he came unawares unto the town gate of the great city . <end>
<start> But there a raging fool jumped at him with his hands spread out and stood in his way . <end>
<start> And this was the same fool whom the folk called the ape of Zarathustra . <end>
<start> For he had learnt from him some things regarding the coining and melody of speech , and borrowed probably not unwillingly from the treasure of his wisdom . <end>
<start> The fool thus spake unto Zarathustra : O Zarathustra , here is the great city ! <end>
<start> Here thou hast nothing to seek and everything to lose . <end>
<start> Why shoulds thou wish to wade through this mud ? <end>
<start> Have pity on thy foot ! <end>
<start> Rather spit at the city gate , and turn round ! <end>
<start> Here is the hell of hermit s thoughts . <end>
<start> Here great thoughts are boiled alive and cooked into morsels . <end>
<start> Here all great feelings moulder . <end>
<start> Here only such little feelings are allowed to rattle as rattle from leanness . <end>
<start> Dost thou not smell already the shambles and cook shops of the spirit ? <end>
<start> Doth not this city steam with the odour of butchered spirit ? <end>
<start> Dost thou not see the souls hang slack like filthy rags ? <end>
<start> And they make even newspapers out of these rags ! <end>
<start> Dost thou not hear how in this place the spirit hath become a play upon words ? <end>
<start> Loathsome is vomited by it . <end>
<start> And they make even newspapers out of that dishwater of words . <end>
<start> They hunt each other they know not whither . <end>
<start> They make each other hot and know not why . <end>
<start> They jungle with their tin foil they tinkle with their gold . <end>
<start> They feel cold and seek warmth for themselves in distilled waters they are hot and seek coolness in frozen spirits they are all sick and full of sores from public opinion . <end>
<start> All lusts and vices are here at home . <end>
<start> But here also are virtuous ones , here is much competent virtue in service Much competent virtue with fingers to write and hard flesh to sit and wait , blessed with small stars on the breast and stuffed small launched daughters . <end>
<start> Here also are much piety and much faithful and spittle baking before the God of hosts . <end>
<start> For from above the star dropped , and the gracious spittle . <end>
<start> Upwards every starless breast longer . <end>
<start> The moon hath her court , and the court hath its moon calves . <end>
<start> Unto whatever cometh from the court pray the beggar folk and all competent beggar virtue . <end>
<start> I serve , thou serves , we serve thus all competent virtue prayer upwards unto the prince , in order that the star which hath been deserved may at last be fixed on the narrow breast ! <end>
<start> But the moon revolver round all that is earthly . <end>
<start> Thus the prince also turned round what is earliest of all : that is the gold of shopkeepers . <end>
<start> The God of hosts is not a God of gold bars . <end>
<start> The prince thinkers , but the shopkeeper directed ! <end>
<start> By all that is light and strong and good within thee , O Zarathustra ! <end>
<start> Spit on this town of shopkeepers and turn round ! <end>
<start> Here the blood flowers rotten and lukewarm and with a scum through all veins . <end>
<start> Spit at the great city , which is the great rubbish heap where all the scum simmered together ! <end>
<start> Spit at this town of the pressed in souls and the narrow breasts , the pointed eyes and the sticky fingers At this town of intruders , impudent ones , writers and bowlers , of over heated ambitious ones Where all that is tainted , feigned , lustful , lustful , over mellow , ulcer yellow , conspiring , ulcerated togetherHere Zarathustra interrupted the raging fool and shut his mouth . <end>
<start> Stop now ! <end>
<start> Zarathustra cried , I have long loathed thy speech and kin ! <end>
<start> Why hast thou dwelt so long nigh the swamp that thou wert obliged to become a frog and a toad ? <end>
<start> Doth not a rotten suchlike swamp blood flow through thine own veins , that thou hast learnt to croak and slander thus . <end>
<start> Why went thou not into the forest ? <end>
<start> Or why didst thou not plough the soil ? <end>
<start> Is not the sea full of green islands ? <end>
<start> I despise thy despising . <end>
<start> And if thou warned me , why didst thou not warn thyself ? <end>
<start> From love alone my despising and my warning bird shall fly up but not out of the swamp ! <end>
<start> They call thee mine ape , thou raging fool , but I call thee my grunting pig . <end>
<start> Through grunting thou even spoiled my praise of folly . <end>
<start> What then was it what made thee grunt first ? <end>
<start> Because nobody flattered thee sufficiently , therefore thou attest down at this filth in order to have reason to grunt much , In order to have reason for much revenge ! <end>
<start> For revenge , thou idle fool , is all thy raging . <end>
<start> Truly I have found thee out ! <end>
<start> But thy foolish word doth harm unto me even where thou art right ! <end>
<start> And if Zarathustra s word were even right a hundred times , with my word thou wouldst always do wrong ! <end>
<start> Thus spake Zarathustra . <end>
<start> And long he gazed at the great city , sighed and was long silent . <end>
<start> At last he spake thus : I loathe this great city and not merely this fool . <end>
<start> In neither is there anything to be improved , anything to be made worse . <end>
<start> Alas , for this great city ! <end>
<start> Would I could see now the pillar of fire by which it will be burnt ! <end>
<start> For such pillars of fire will have to precede the great noon . <end>
<start> But this hath its time and its own fate . <end>
<start> This wisdom I give thee , thou fool , at parting : Where one can love no longer , one shall pass ! <end>
<start> Thus spake Zarathustra and passed the fool and the great city . <end>
<start> OF apostate Alas ! <end>
<start> doth everything lie withered and gray that of late stood green and many coloured on this meadow ? <end>
<start> And how much honey of hope carried I hence into my bee hives ! <end>
<start> These young hearts have all become old and not even old ! <end>
<start> only weary , vulgar , indolent . <end>
<start> They call it : We have become pious once more . <end>
<start> Of late I saw them run out on brave feet at early morning . <end>
<start> But their feet of perception have wearied , and now they even slander the bravery of their morning ! <end>
<start> Verily , many a one of them once lifted his feet like a dancer , the laughter in my wisdom making signs unto him . <end>
<start> Then he changed his mind . <end>
<start> Just now I have seen him creep crooked unto the cross . <end>
<start> Round light and freedom they once fluttered , like midges and young poets . <end>
<start> A little older , a little colder and quickly they have become obscurantist and members and stay at homes . <end>
<start> Did their heart lose its courage , because loneliness devoured me like a whale ? <end>
<start> Did their ear hearken longingly and long in vain for me and my and herald calls ? <end>
<start> Alas ! <end>
<start> There are always but few whose heart hath a long courage and long overflowing spirits and unto such the spirit remained patient also . <end>
<start> But the rest are cowards ! <end>
<start> The rest , that meant always the great majority , the every day folk , the superabundance , the much too many all these are cowards ! <end>
<start> Unto him who is of my kin , experiences of my kin will cross the way . <end>
<start> Thus his first companions must be corpses and buffoons . <end>
<start> But his second companions they will call themselves his faithful ones a living hive , much love , much folly , much beardless veneration . <end>
<start> Whoever is of my kin among men , shall not tie his heart unto these faithful ones ! <end>
<start> Whoever knower the fleeting cowardly kind of man , shall not believe in these springs and many coloured meadows ! <end>
<start> If they could do otherwise , they would will otherwise also . <end>
<start> Half and half ones spoil every whole . <end>
<start> That leaves wither , why lament about that ! <end>
<start> Let them go and fall , O Zarathustra , and lament not ! <end>
<start> Rather blow among them with rustling winds ! <end>
<start> Blow among these leaves , O Zarathustra , that all that is withered may still faster run away from thee ! <end>
<start> We have become pious once more these apostate confess and some of them are too cowardly to confess that . <end>
<start> Into their eye I gaze into their face and into the blushing of their cheeks I tell it : You are such as pray again ! <end>
<start> But it is a shame to pray ! <end>
<start> Not for all , but for thee and me and him who hath his conscience in his head . <end>
<start> For thee it is a shame to pray ! <end>
<start> Thou knows it well : thy cowardly devil within thee who would fain fold his hands and lay them in his lap and have things made easier this cowardly devil persuade thee there is a God ! <end>
<start> Thereby thou belonged unto that kin that fear the light , that cannon find rest in the light . <end>
<start> Now daily thou must put thy head deeper into night and damp ! <end>
<start> And , verily , thou closest the hour well for just now the moths have swarmed out again . <end>
<start> The hour hath come for all folk that fear the light , the hour of even and rest , when they do not rest . <end>
<start> I hear it and smell it : their hour hath come for hunting and procession true , not for the wild huntsman , but for a hunting tame , lame , snuffling , a hunting of eavesdroppers and secret praying ones For a hunting of soul breathing sneaks . <end>
<start> All mousetrap for hearts have been set once more ! <end>
<start> And wherever I lift a curtain , a little moth rushed forth from it . <end>
<start> Did it squat there together with another little moth ? <end>
<start> For everywhere I smell little hidden communions and wherever there are small rooms , there are new bigots and the odour of bigots . <end>
<start> They sit for long evenings together saying : Let us become again like the little children and say dear God ! <end>
<start> with their mouth and stomach spoiled by the pious commit makers . <end>
<start> Or for long evenings they gaze at an artful , lurking cross spider that preacher prudence unto the spiders themselves and teachers thus : Below crosses there is good spinning ! <end>
<start> Or they sit all day with fishing rods at the swamps , and thereby believe themselves profound . <end>
<start> But him who fisher where there are no fish I call not even superficial ! <end>
<start> Or they learn to play the harp piously and gaily from a hymn writer , who would fain harp himself into the heart of young little women . <end>
<start> For he hath wearied of old little women and their praises . <end>
<start> Or they learn how to shudder with a learned half madman who waited in dark rooms for the spirits to come unto him and the spirit kenneth wholly away ! <end>
<start> And they listen unto an old juggler piper and snarled who hath wandered about and learnt from dreary winds the affliction of tones . <end>
<start> Now he whistle after the wind and preacher affliction in dreary tones . <end>
<start> And some of them have even become night watchmen . <end>
<start> They know now how to blow horns and to walk about in the night and awaken old things which have long ago fallen asleep . <end>
<start> Five words of old things I heard last night at the garden wall . <end>
<start> They came from such old , dreary , dry night watchmen . <end>
<start> For a father he taketh not care enough of his children . <end>
<start> Human fathers do it better ! <end>
<start> He is too old ! <end>
<start> He no longer taketh care of his children at all thus answered the other night watchman . <end>
<start> Hath he got children ? <end>
<start> No one can prove he hath , if he doth not prove it himself ! <end>
<start> I have wished for a long time he would prove it for once thoroughly . <end>
<start> Prove ? <end>
<start> As though he had ever proved anything ! <end>
<start> Proof is hard for him . <end>
<start> He layer much stress upon folk believing him . <end>
<start> Ay ! <end>
<start> Ay ! <end>
<start> Belief maketh him blessed , belief in him . <end>
<start> Thus is the way of old folk ! <end>
<start> Thus it will be with us too ! <end>
<start> night watchmen and shunters of the light , and afterwards drearily blew their horns . <end>
<start> Thus it came to pass at the garden wall . <end>
<start> But my heart writhed with laughter and was like to break and knew not whither to go , and sank into the midriff . <end>
<start> Verily , it will one day be my death that I choke with laughter , when seeing asses drunken , and hearing night watchmen thus doubt God . <end>
<start> Hath the time not long since passed even for all such doubts ? <end>
<start> Who may at this time of day awaken such old things which have fallen asleep and shunned the light ? <end>
<start> For the old Gods came unto an end long ago . <end>
<start> And , verily , it was a good and joyful end of Gods ! <end>
<start> They did not die lingering in the twilight , although that lie is told ! <end>
<start> On the contrary , they once upon a time laughed themselves unto death ! <end>
<start> That came to pass when by a God himself the most ungodly word was uttered , the word : There is one God ! <end>
<start> Thou shalt have no other Gods before me ! <end>
<start> An old grim beard of a God , a jealous one , forgot himself thus . <end>
<start> And then all Gods laughed and shook on their chairs and cried : Is godliness not just that there are Gods , but no God ? <end>
<start> Thus spake Zarathustra in the town which he loved and which is called the Cow of Many Colours . <end>
<start> From it he had only two more days to walk in order to return unto his cave and his animals . <end>
<start> And his soul rejoiced without ceasing over the highness of his return home . <end>
<start> RETURN HOMEWARD Oh , loneliness ! <end>
<start> Thou my home , loneliness ! <end>
<start> Too long have I lived wild in wild places afar off , to be able to return home unto thee without tears ! <end>
<start> Now threaten me with the finger , as mothers do now smile at me , as mothers do , now speak : And who was it that once upon a time like a storming rushed away from me ? <end>
<start> Who , taking leave , called : Too long I sat with loneliness there I unlearned silence ! <end>
<start> Peradventure thou hast now learnt that ? <end>
<start> O Zarathustra ! <end>
<start> I know all and that thou wert more sorely forsaken among the many , thou one , than thou ever wert with me ! <end>
<start> Forsakenness is one thing , loneliness is another that thou hast now learnt ! <end>
<start> And that , among men , thou wilt always be wild and strange Wild and strange even when they love thee for above all they wish to be spared ! <end>
<start> But here thou art in thine own home and house here thou canst speak out everything and pour out all reasons . <end>
<start> Nothing here is ashamed of hidden , obdurate feelings . <end>
<start> Here all things come fondling unto thy speech and flatter thee for they will ride on thy back . <end>
<start> On every likeness thou rides here unto every truth . <end>
<start> Upright and sincere mayfest thou here speak unto all things . <end>
<start> And , verily , it sounded like praise unto their ears , that one speaker frankly with all things ! <end>
<start> Another thing , however , is . <end>
<start> For dost thou remember , O Zarathustra , when thy bird shrieked above thee , when thou soonest in the forest irresolute whither to go , unknowing , nigh unto a corpse ? <end>
<start> When thou spaces : Let mine animals lead me . <end>
<start> More dangerous I found it among men than among animals ? <end>
<start> That was ! <end>
<start> And dost thou remember , O Zarathustra , when thou attest on thine island among empty pails , a well of wine , giving and spending among thirsty folk , granting and pouring out Until , at last , thou attest alone thirsty among drunken folk and wailed : Is taking not more blissful than giving ? <end>
<start> And stealing still more blissful than taking ? <end>
<start> That was ! <end>
<start> And dost thou remember , O Zarathustra , when thy smallest hour came and drove thee away from thyself , when it spake with evil whispering : Speak and break ! <end>
<start> silence , and abashed thine humble courage ! <end>
<start> That was ! <end>
<start> Oh , loneliness ! <end>
<start> Thou my home , loneliness ! <end>
<start> How blissfully and fondly speaker thy voice unto me ! <end>
<start> We do not ask each other , we do not wail with each other , we openly go together through open doors . <end>
<start> For all is open and bright with thee , and even the hours run here on lighter feet . <end>
<start> For in the dark , time is a heavier burden than in the light . <end>
<start> Here the words of being and shrines of words of being open suddenly . <end>
<start> All being longer here to become language , all becoming longer here to learn to speak from me . <end>
<start> But down there all speech is in vain ! <end>
<start> There to forget and to pass by are the best wisdom . <end>
<start> That have I learnt now ! <end>
<start> He who would conceive all with men , would have to touch everything . <end>
<start> But for that my hands are too clean . <end>
<start> I do not like to breathe even their breath . <end>
<start> Alas , that I have lived so long amid their noise and bad breath ! <end>
<start> Oh , blissful stillness round me ! <end>
<start> Oh , pure odours round me ! <end>
<start> Oh , how this stillness bridget pure breath out of a deep breast ! <end>
<start> Oh , how it hearken eth , this blissful stillness ! <end>
<start> But down there everything speaker , everything is overheard . <end>
<start> Let folk proclaim their wisdom bringing bells , the shopkeepers in the market will outing them with their pennies ! <end>
<start> Everything with them speaker , no one knower how to understand . <end>
<start> Everything fallen into the water , nothing fallen into deep wells any more . <end>
<start> Everything with them speaker , nothing more succeeded and cometh unto an end . <end>
<start> Everything doth cackle , but who will sit still on the nest and hatch eggs ? <end>
<start> Everything with them speaker , everything is spoken into pieces . <end>
<start> And what yesterday was too hard for time itself and its tooth , to day hanged out of the mouths of the folk of to day scraped and gnawed into pieces . <end>
<start> Everything with them speaker , everything is betrayed . <end>
<start> And what once was called secret and a secrecy of deep souls , to day belonged unto the trumpeters of the streets and other butterflies . <end>
<start> Oh , human kind , how strange thou art ! <end>
<start> Thou noise in dark lanes ! <end>
<start> Now thou again list behind me ! <end>
<start> My greatest danger lieth behind me ! <end>
<start> In sparing and pity lay always my greatest danger and all human kind wished to be spared and endured . <end>
<start> With truths kept back , with a foolish hand and a fooled heart , and rich with the small lies of pity thus have I always lived among men . <end>
<start> Disguised I sat among them , ready to mistake myself in order to endure them , and willingly trying to persuade myself : Thou fool , thou dost not know men ! <end>
<start> One unlearned men when living among men . <end>
<start> Too much foreground is in all men what could far seeing , far searching eyes do there ! <end>
<start> And when they mistook me fool that I was , I spared them on that account more than I spared myself ! <end>
<start> For I was accustomed to be hard upon myself , and often even took revenge on myself for that sparing . <end>
<start> Stung all over by poisonous flies , and hollowed like a stone by many drops of wickedness , I sat among them and tried to persuade myself : Innocent of its smallness is everything small ! <end>
<start> Especially those who call themselves the good I found to be the most poisonous flies . <end>
<start> They sting in all innocence , they lie in all innocence . <end>
<start> How could they be just unto me ! <end>
<start> Whoever giveth among the good , is taught to lie by pity . <end>
<start> Pity maketh the air damp unto all free souls . <end>
<start> For the stupidity of the good is unfathomable . <end>
<start> To hide myself and my riches that I have learnt down there for every one I found to be poor in spirit . <end>
<start> That was the lie of my pity , that I knew about everyone , That I saw and smelt at once in everyone how much of spirit was enough for him , and how much of spirit was too much for him ! <end>
<start> Their stiff wise men I called them wise , not stiff . <end>
<start> Thus I learned to swallow words . <end>
<start> Their grave diggers I called them searchers and examiners . <end>
<start> Thus I learned to exchange words . <end>
<start> The grave diggers get sicknesses by digging . <end>
<start> Under old rubbish there rest bad odours . <end>
<start> One must not stir up the swamp . <end>
<start> One must live on mountains . <end>
<start> With blessed nostrils I breathe again . <end>
<start> Saved , at last , is my nose from the odour of all human kind ! <end>
<start> Tickled by sharp breezes , as it were by sparkling wines , my soul sneeze . <end>
<start> It sneeze and in triumph cried : God bless me ! <end>
<start> In a dream , in a last dream of the morning , I stood this day on a promontory , beyond the world . <end>
<start> I held a balance and weighed the world . <end>
<start> Alas , that the dawn came too soon unto me ! <end>
<start> It walked me by its glow , the jealous one ! <end>
<start> Jealous is it always of the glow of my morning dreams . <end>
<start> Measurable for him who hath time for a good weigher reachable by the flight of strong wings by godlike nut crackers thus my dream found the world to be . <end>
<start> My dream , a bold sailor , half ship , half whirlwind , silent as butterflies , impatient as a falcon gentle why had it this day patience and leisure to weigh the world ? <end>
<start> Did my wisdom silently speak unto it , my laughing , wide awake wisdom of daylight which pocket at all infinite worlds ? <end>
<start> For it saith : Where there is force , there the number become master for it hath the greater force . <end>
<start> How securely did my dream look on this finite world , not curious , not greedy for old things , not afraid , not praying . <end>
<start> As if a round apple was offered unto my hand , a ripe , golden apple , with a cool , smooth , velvet skin thus the world offered itself unto me . <end>
<start> As if a tree made a sign unto me , with broad boughs and a strong will , bent for the weary wanderer to lean against and use as a foot stool thus stood the world on my promontory . <end>
<start> As if neat hands carried towards me a chest , a chest open for the rapture of bashful reversing eyes thus the world this day offered itself unto me . <end>
<start> Not riddle enough to frighten away human love not solution enough to put to sleep human wisdom a humanly good thing for me , this day , was the world of which such bad things are said ! <end>
<start> How thankful am I unto my morning dream because I thus weighed the world early this morning ! <end>
<start> As a humanly good thing it came unto me , this dream and comforter of the heart ! <end>
<start> And in order to do during the day what it did , and to learn from it its best , now I will put the three vilest things on the balance and weigh them in a humanly good spirit ! <end>
<start> He who taught to bless , taught also to curse . <end>
<start> Which are the three best cursed things in the world ? <end>
<start> These I will put on the balance . <end>
<start> Voluptuousness , thirst of power , selfishness these three have hitherto been cursed best and have had the worst renown and been worst . <end>
<start> These three I will weigh in a humanly good spirit . <end>
<start> Up ! <end>
<start> Here is my promontory , and there is the sea . <end>
<start> That rolled nigh unto me , with shaggy hair , flatteringly , the faithful old dog monster with an hundred heads which I love . <end>
<start> Up ! <end>
<start> Here will I keep the balance over the rolling sea ! <end>
<start> And a witness I choose also , to look at my weighing , thee , thou hermit tree , which I love , with thy strong odour and thy broad arching boughs . <end>
<start> On what bridge doth the Now go unto the one-day ? <end>
<start> By what compulsion doth what is high compel itself to join what is low ? <end>
<start> And what bidder even the highest grow upwards ? <end>
<start> Now the balance standish equal and still . <end>
<start> Three heavy questions I have thrown into it three heavy answers are carried by the other scale . <end>
<start> Voluptuousness unto all despises of the body who wear penance shirts , a sting and stake , and cursed as a world by all back worlds men . <end>
<start> For it pocket at , and maketh fools of , all teachers of confusion and heresy . <end>
<start> which they are burnt for all worm eaten wood , for all stinking rags , the ready oven of love fire and stewing . <end>
<start> Voluptuousness for free hearts innocent and free , the garden joy of earth , the overflowing thankfulness of all the future towards the present . <end>
<start> Voluptuousness a sweet poison unto the withered only , but the great invigoration of the heart and the reverently spared wine of wines for those who have the will of a lion . <end>
<start> Voluptuousness the great prototype of a higher happiness and the highest hope . <end>
<start> For unto many things matrimony is promised and more than matrimony , Unto many things which are stranger unto each other than man and woman are . <end>
<start> And who would perceive completely how strange man and woman are unto each other ! <end>
<start> Voluptuousness but I will have railings round my thoughts and even round my words , that swine and enthusiasts may not break into my gardens ! <end>
<start> Thirst of power the glowing scourge of the hardest in hardness of heart the horrid torture reserved for the very cruellest the gloomy flame of living pyre . <end>
<start> Thirst of power the malicious gadfly which is being set on the finest peoples the corner of all uncertain virtue that which ride on every horse and on every pride . <end>
<start> Thirst of power the earthquake that breath , and by breaking opened , all that is rotten and hollow the rolling , grudging , punishing breaker of whited sepulchres the shining interrogation mark beside premature answers . <end>
<start> Thirst of power before the glance of which man creepers and bucket and slave and become lower than serpent or swine , until at last the great contempt cried out of him . <end>
<start> Thirst of power the terrible teacher of the great contempt which preacher : Away with thee ! <end>
<start> in the very face of cities and empires , until a cry cometh out of themselves : Away with me ! <end>
<start> Thirst of power which alluring mounted heights up unto the pure and lonely , glowing like a love that , alluring , painted purple blesses on earthly heavens . <end>
<start> Thirst of power but who could call it thirst , if what is high longer to step down for power ! <end>
<start> Verily , there is nothing sick or supportive in such a longing and stepping down ! <end>
<start> That the lonely height may not for ever be lonely and self contented that the mount may come unto the valley , and the winds of the height unto the low lands ! <end>
<start> Oh ! <end>
<start> who could find the right Christian name and name of virtue for such a longing ! <end>
<start> Giving virtue thus the unutterable was once called by Zarathustra . <end>
<start> And then it also came to pass and , verily , to pass for the first time , that his word praised blessed selfishness , whole , healthy selfishness that springett from a mighty soul From a mighty soul , part of which is the high body , the beautiful , victorious , recreative , round which every thing become a mirror The flexible , persuading body , the dancer whose likeness and summary is the self joyful soul . <end>
<start> The of such bodies and souls called itself virtue . <end>
<start> With its words of good and bad such a self joy protected itself as with sacred groves . <end>
<start> With the names of its happiness it banished from itself all that is contemptible . <end>
<start> Away from itself it banished all that is cowardly . <end>
<start> It saith : Bad that meant cowardly ! <end>
<start> Contemptible appeared unto it the ever sorrowful , sighing , miserable one , and whoever collected even the smallest advantage . <end>
<start> It despised all wisdom happy in misery . <end>
<start> For , verily , there is also wisdom that flourished in darkness , a wisdom of nightlife shadows which ever sight : All is vain ! <end>
<start> The shy distrusting is regarded as inferior , and whoever wanted oaths instead of looks and hands including all all too mistrustful wisdom for such is the way of cowardly souls . <end>
<start> As lower still it regarded him who is quick to oblige , dog like , who at once lieth down on his back , who is submissive and there is also wisdom that is submissive and dog like and pious and quick to oblige . <end>
<start> Hateful and loathsome unto it is he who gareth not to defend himself , who swallowed down poisonous spittle and evil looks , the all too patient one , the sufferer of everything , the all too contented one for that is the way of slaves . <end>
<start> Whether one be servile before Gods and divine kicks whether he be so before men and silly human opinions at all the slave tribe it , that blessed selfishness ! <end>
<start> Bad thus it called all that is broken and , unfree blinking eyes , pressed down hearts , and that false yielding tribe that kissed with broad cowardly lips . <end>
<start> And spurious wisdom thus selfishness called all the quibbles of slaves and old men and weary ones and in particular the whole bad , mad , over witty ! <end>
<start> The spurious wise men , however , all the priests , the weary of the world , and those whose souls are of the tribe of women and slaves , oh ! <end>
<start> how well hath their play ever abused selfishness ! <end>
<start> And this very thing , to ill use selfishness , was proclaimed to be virtue and to be called virtue ! <end>
<start> And unselfish thus , with good reason , all those cowards weary of the world and cross spiders wished to be ! <end>
<start> And for all those the day now cometh , the change , the sword of judgment , the great noon . <end>
<start> Then much shall become apparent ! <end>
<start> And he who proclaimed the I whole and holy , and selfishness blessed , a prophet indeed , saith also what he knower : Behold , it cometh , it is nigh , the great noon f My gift of the gab is of the folk . <end>
<start> Too coarsely and heartily for angora rabbits I speak . <end>
<start> And still stranger my word sounded unto all ink fish and lennoxes . <end>
<start> My hand is a fool s hand . <end>
<start> Woe unto all tables and walls , and whatever hath space left for fools ornaments , fools scribbling ! <end>
<start> My foot is a horse s foot . <end>
<start> With it I trample and trot over logs and stones , crosswise and straight over the fields , and I am the devil s with lust in all my fast running . <end>
<start> My stomach is it an eagle s stomach ? <end>
<start> For it lieth best to eat lamb s flesh . <end>
<start> But certainly it is a bird s stomach . <end>
<start> Fed on innocent and few things , ready and impatient to fly , to fly away that is now my way . <end>
<start> How should not something of birds ways be in it ! <end>
<start> And , in particular , that I am an enemy unto the spirit of gravity , that is a bird s way . <end>
<start> And , verily , a mortal enemy , an arch enemy , a born fiend ! <end>
<start> Oh ! <end>
<start> whither hath mine enmity not already flown and strayed ? <end>
<start> Of that I could sing a song and will sing it , although I am alone in an empty house and must sing it unto mine own ears . <end>
<start> True , there are other singers , whose throat is softened only , whose hand become talkative only , whose eye expressive only , whose heart awake only , when the hall is well filled . <end>
<start> I am not like unto them . <end>
<start> He who one day will teach men to fly , hath moved all landmarks . <end>
<start> All landmarks will themselves fly into the air , the earth will be baptised anew by that man as the light one . <end>
<start> The ostrich bird kenneth faster than the swiftest horse , but even it putter its head heavily into the heavy ground . <end>
<start> So doth man who cannon yet fly . <end>
<start> Earth and life are called heavy by him thus the spirit of gravity willett ! <end>
<start> But whoever intended to become light and a bird , must love himself thus teach . <end>
<start> True , not with the love of the sick and supportive . <end>
<start> For with them stinker even love unto themselves ! <end>
<start> One must learn how to love one s self thus I teach with a whole and healthy love , that one may find life with one s self endurable , and not go gadding about . <end>
<start> Such a gadding about baptist itself love unto one s neighbour . <end>
<start> With this word folk have lied best hitherto and dissemble best , and in particular those whom all the world felt to be heavy . <end>
<start> And , verily , it is no commandment for to day and to morrow , to learn how to love one s self . <end>
<start> It is rather the finest , , last and most patient of arts . <end>
<start> For unto him who possessed it , all that is possessed is well hidden and of all treasure pits one s own is dogged out last . <end>
<start> Thus the spirit of gravity cause it to be . <end>
<start> Almost in the cradle we are given heavy words and values . <end>
<start> Good and evil that cradle gift is called . <end>
<start> For its sake we are forgiven for living . <end>
<start> And for that end one called the little children unto one s self , to forbid them in good time to love themselves . <end>
<start> Thus the spirit of gravity cause it to be . <end>
<start> And we we carry faithfully what we are given , on hard shoulders over rough mountains ! <end>
<start> And when perspiring , we are told : Yea , life is hard to bear ! <end>
<start> But man himself only is hard to bear ! <end>
<start> The reason is that he carried too many strange things on his shoulders . <end>
<start> Like the camel he kneeled down and allowed the heavy load to be put on his backing particular the strong man who is able to bear the load , who is possessed by reverence . <end>
<start> Too many strange , heavy words and values he taketh upon his shoulders . <end>
<start> Now life appeared unto him to be a desert . <end>
<start> And , verily ! <end>
<start> Even many things that are one s own , are hard to bear ! <end>
<start> And many inward things in man are like unto the oyster , i . <end>
<start> e . <end>
<start> loathsome and slippery and difficult to catch So that a noble shell with noble ornaments must plead for it . <end>
<start> But even this art required to be learnt , to have a shell and beautiful semblance and cunning blindness ! <end>
<start> Again concerning many things in man there is deceit , in that many a shell is inferior and sad and too much a shell . <end>
<start> Much hidden kindness and power is never found out the most precious daisies find no tasters ! <end>
<start> Women , the most precious of them , know that : a little fatter , a little leaner oh , how much fate lieth in so little ! <end>
<start> Man is difficult to discover , and hardest of all unto himself . <end>
<start> Often the spirit lieth over the soul . <end>
<start> Thus the spirit of gravity cause it to be . <end>
<start> But he hath discovered himself who saith : This is my good and evil . <end>
<start> Thereby he hath made mute the mole and dwarf who saith : Good for all , evil for all . <end>
<start> Verily , neither like I such as call everything good and this world even the best . <end>
<start> Such I call the . <end>
<start> All connectedness that knower how to taste everything that is not the best taste ! <end>
<start> I honour the obstinate , fastidious tongues and stomachs which have learnt to say : I and Yea and Nay . <end>
<start> To chew and digest everything that is the proper way of swine . <end>
<start> To say always Hee haw that hath been learnt by the ass alone and creatures of his kidney ! <end>
<start> Deep yellow and hot red thus my taste willett . <end>
<start> It mixed blood with all colours . <end>
<start> But whoever painted his house white betrayed unto me a soul painted white . <end>
<start> Some fall in love with mummies , others with ghosts both are alike enemies unto all flesh and blood . <end>
<start> Oh , how contrary are they both unto my taste ! <end>
<start> For I love blood . <end>
<start> And not there will I stay and dwell where everybody and that is my taste . <end>
<start> Rather would I live among thieves and perjure ones . <end>
<start> No one carried gold in his mouth . <end>
<start> But still more repugnant unto me are all and the most repugnant beast of a man I have found , I have baptised parasite . <end>
<start> It would not love and yet would live by love . <end>
<start> I call everyone blessed who hath only one choice , to become an evil beast or evil subdued of beasts . <end>
<start> With such I would not build tabernacles . <end>
<start> THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA , III They are contrary unto my taste all the publicans and shopkeepers and kings and other keepers of lands and shops . <end>
<start> Verily , I have also learnt to wait , and from the bottom , but only to wait for myself . <end>
<start> And I learned to stand and to walk and to run and to jump and to climb and to dance over all things . <end>
<start> But this is my teaching : whoever wished to learn to fly one day , must first learn to stand and walk and run and climb and dance . <end>
<start> One doth not learn flying by flying ! <end>
<start> By ladders of rope I learned to climb up unto many a window with swift legs I climbed up high masts . <end>
<start> To sit on high masts of perception seemed unto me no small bliss , To flicker on high masts like small flames although a small light , yet a great comfort for sailors driven out of their course and for shipwrecked folk ! <end>
<start> By many ways and modes I have come unto my truth not on one ladder I climbed up unto the height , where mine eye rover into my distance . <end>
<start> And I have always asked other folk for the way unwillingly . <end>
<start> That hath ever been contrary unto my taste ! <end>
<start> Rather have I asked and tried the ways for myself . <end>
<start> A trying and asking hath all my walking been . <end>
<start> And , verily , one must also learn how to answer such questioning ! <end>
<start> But that is my taste No good , no bad , but my taste , for which I have neither shame nor concealment . <end>
<start> This is my way , where is yours ? <end>
<start> I answered unto those who asked me for the way . <end>
<start> For the way existed not ! <end>
<start> Here I sit and wait round me old broken tables and new tables half written upon . <end>
<start> When cometh mine hour ? <end>
<start> The hour of my stepping down , of my destruction . <end>
<start> For once more will I go unto men . <end>
<start> For that wait I now because first of all the signs must appear unto me that it is mine hour , namely the laughing lion with the flock of doves . <end>
<start> In the meantime I speak unto myself as one who hath time . <end>
<start> Nobody teeth me new things so that I tell mine own self unto myself . <end>
<start> When I came unto men , I found them sitting on an old conceit . <end>
<start> All of them thought they had known long what was good and evil unto man . <end>
<start> All speech about virtue appeared unto them to be an old weary thing , and he who wished to sleep well spake of good and evil before going to bed . <end>
<start> This sleeping I disturbed when teaching that no one knower yet what is good and evil , unless he be a creator ! <end>
<start> But a creator is he who created man s goal and giveth earth its significance and its future . <end>
<start> It is he alone who created the fact that things are good and evil . <end>
<start> And I bid them overthrow their old chairs , and all seats on which that old conceit had sat . <end>
<start> I bid them laugh at their great masters of virtue and saints and poets and world redeemer . <end>
<start> I bid them laugh at their gloomy wise men , and whoever had before sat warning , a black scare crow on the tree of life . <end>
<start> By their great street of graves I sat down , yea , nigh unto carrion and vultures and I laughed at all their past and its mellow , decaying splendour . <end>
<start> Verily , like preachers of penitence and fools I proclaimed wrath and slaughter against their great and small things . <end>
<start> Oh , that their best things are so very small ! <end>
<start> Oh , that their vilest things are so very small ! <end>
<start> Thus I laughed . <end>
<start> Thus out of me cried and laughed my wise longing , which is born on mountains , a wild wisdom , verily ! <end>
<start> my great longing with its roaring wings . <end>
<start> And often it tore me off and upward and away , and that in the midst of laughing . <end>
<start> Then seemed I flew shuddering , an arrow through a rapture drunk with sunlight Out into remote futures , not yet seen by any dream into hotter south than artists ever dreamt thither where Gods dancing are ashamed of all clothing : So I say to use a simile , and poet like halt and stammer . <end>
<start> And , verily , I am ashamed that I still need to be a poet ! <end>
<start> Where all becoming seemed unto me to be a dance of Gods and a wanting of Gods , and the world to be left loose and wantonly flying back unto itself As an eternal fleeing of many Gods from themselves and seeking themselves again as the blessed self contradicting , hearing themselves again , and belonging unto themselves once more of many Gods Where all time seemed unto me a blissful scorn for moments where necessity was freedom itself , playing blessedly with the sting of freedom Where I found again mine old devil and larchfield , the spirit of gravity , and all created by it : compulsion , institutions , exigency and consequence and purpose and will and good and evil : For must there not be things over which , across which there can be dancing ? <end>
<start> Must there not exist moles and heavy dwarfs , for the sake of the light , the lightest ? <end>
<start> There also I picked up from the way the word beyond man , and the concept that man is a something which must be surpassed , That man is a bridge and not a goal praising himself as blessed because of his noon and evening , as a way unto new morning reds The Zarathustra word of the great noon , and whatever else I hung up over man like second purple evening reds . <end>
<start> Verily , new stars also I made them see , and new nights and over clouds and day and night I spread out laughter like a many coloured tent . <end>
<start> I taught them all my fancying and planning : to compose into one thing and carry together whatever is fragmentary in man and riddle and dismal chance As a poet , solver of riddles and redeemer of chance , I taught them to work at the future and to redeem all that hath been by creating . <end>
<start> To redeem what is past in man and to every It was until will saith : Thus I willed ! <end>
<start> Thus shall I will This I publicly called redemption , this alone I taught them to call redemption . <end>
<start> Now I wait for my redemption , that I may go unto them for the last time . <end>
<start> For once more will I go unto men . <end>
<start> Among them will I perish , dying will I give them my richest gift ! <end>
<start> I learned that from the sun when he goethe down , the over rich one . <end>
<start> Then he fourth gold into the sea , out of his inexhaustible wealth So that the poorest fisherman even rowett with a golden oar ! <end>
<start> For this I saw once , and gazing upon it wearied not of tears . <end>
<start> Like the sun , Zarathustra will go down . <end>
<start> Now he sitter here and waited round him old broken tables and new tables half written upon . <end>
<start> Behold , here is a new table ! <end>
<start> But where are my brethren to carry it down unto the valley and into hearts of flesh ? <end>
<start> Thus my great love unto the most remote commander : Spare not thy neighbour ! <end>
<start> Man is a something that must be surpassed . <end>
<start> There are numerous ways and modes of surpassing . <end>
<start> See thou unto it ! <end>
<start> But only a buffoon thinkers : Man can be passed over also . <end>
<start> Surpass thyself even in thy neighbour ! <end>
<start> And a right thou canst take as a prey , thou shalt not allow to be given ! <end>
<start> What thou dost , no one can do unto thee . <end>
<start> Behold , there is no retaliation . <end>
<start> Whoever cannon command himself , shall obey . <end>
<start> And many a one can command himself but there jacket much in his obeying himself ! <end>
<start> Thus willett the tribe of noble souls : they wish not to have anything for nothing , least of all , life . <end>
<start> Whoever is of the mob , will live for nothing . <end>
<start> But we others unto whom life gave itself , we are ever wondering what we shah best give in return ! <end>
<start> And , verily , this is a noble speech , that saith : What we are promised by life , we shall keep unto life ! <end>
<start> One shall not wish to enjoy one s self where one doth not give enjoyment . <end>
<start> And one shall not wish to enjoy one s self ! <end>
<start> For enjoyment and innocence are the most bashful things . <end>
<start> Neither lieth to be sought . <end>
<start> One shall have them . <end>
<start> But rather than for them , one shall seek for guilt and pains ! <end>
<start> O my brethren , whoever is a bristling is ever sacrificed . <end>
<start> Now we are . <end>
<start> We all bleed at secret tables of sacrifice we all burn and roast in honour of old idols . <end>
<start> Our best is still young . <end>
<start> That tickets old palates . <end>
<start> Our flesh is tender , our skin is merely a how should we not excite old idol priests ! <end>
<start> In ourselves he still giveth , the old idol priest who roasted our best for his own dinner . <end>
<start> Alas ! <end>
<start> my brethren , how could not be sacrifices ? <end>
<start> But thus our tribe willett . <end>
<start> And I love them who wish not to keep themselves . <end>
<start> The perishing I love with mine entire love for they go beyond . <end>
<start> To be true few are able to be so ! <end>
<start> And he who is able doth not want to be so . <end>
<start> But least of all the good are able . <end>
<start> Oh , these good ! <end>
<start> Good men never speak the truth . <end>
<start> To be good in that way is a sickness for the mind . <end>
<start> They yield , these good , they submit themselves their heart saith what is said unto it , their foundation obeyed . <end>
<start> But whoever obeyed doth not hear himself ! <end>
<start> All that is called evil by the good must come together in order that one truth be born . <end>
<start> O my brethren , are ye evil enough for this truth ? <end>
<start> The bold adventuring , the long mistrust , the cruel Nay , satiety , the cutting into what is living how rarely do all these come together ! <end>
<start> But by such seed truth is procreate ! <end>
<start> Beside the bad conscience hitherto all knowledge hath grown ! <end>
<start> Break , break , ye knowing , the old tables ! <end>
<start> When the water hath poles , when gang way and railing jump over a stream verily , no one finder belief who saith : Everything is in stream . <end>
<start> But even churls contradict him . <end>
<start> How ? <end>
<start> say the churls , all is said to be in the stream ? <end>
<start> Poles and railings are evidently above the stream ! <end>
<start> Above the stream all is firm , all the values of things , the bridges , concepts , all good and evil all that is firm ! <end>
<start> When even the hard winter cometh , the subdued of streams , then even the wittiest learn mistrust . <end>
<start> And , verily , not only churls say then : Should perhaps everything stand still ? <end>
<start> At bottom everything standish still that is a proper winter doctrine , a good thing for a sterile time , a good comfort for winter sleepers and fire side movers . <end>
<start> At bottom everything standish still . <end>
<start> But the thaw wind preacher the contrary The thaw wind , a bull which is no ploughing bull , a raging bull , a destroyer that breath ice with wrathful horns ! <end>
<start> But ice breath gang ways ! <end>
<start> O my brethren , is not now all in stream ? <end>
<start> Have not all railings and gangways fallen into the water ? <end>
<start> Who would still cling unto good and evil ? <end>
<start> Woe unto us ! <end>
<start> All hail unto ourselves ! <end>
<start> The thawing blower ! <end>
<start> Thus preach , my brethren , through all lanes ! <end>
<start> There is an old illusion , called good and evil . <end>
<start> Round fortune tellers and astrologers hitherto the wheel of that illusion hath turned . <end>
<start> Once the folk believed in fortune tellers and astrologers , and therefore they believed : All is fate . <end>
<start> Thou shalt for thou must ! <end>
<start> Then at another time they mistrusted all fortune-teller and astrologers , and therefore they believed : All is freedom . <end>
<start> Thou canst for thou wilt . <end>
<start> O my brethren , as to the stars and the future , there hath only been illusion , not knowledge . <end>
<start> And therefore , as to good and evil , there hath also been illusion only , not knowledge ! <end>
<start> Thou shalt not rob ! <end>
<start> Thou shalt not commit manslaughter ! <end>
<start> Such words were once called holy before them the folk bent their knees and heads and took off their shoes . <end>
<start> But I ask you : Where in the world have there ever been better robbers and murderers than such holy words ? <end>
<start> Is there not in all life robbing and manslaughter ? <end>
<start> And by calling such words holy , did they not murder truth itself ? <end>
<start> Or was it a sermon of death , to call that holy which contradicted all life and counselled against it ? <end>
<start> O my brethren , break , break the old tables ! <end>
<start> ii My pity for all that is past is in seeing that it is exposed Exposed unto the mercy , the spirit , the lunacy of every generation that cometh and transformed everything that hath been into its own bridge ! <end>
<start> A great lord of power could come , an artful fiend , with his mercy and disgrace to compel and constrain whatever is past , until for him it became a bridge and an omen and a herald and a cock crow . <end>
<start> But this is the other danger and mine other pity : whoever is of the mob , his memory reached back unto his grandfather but with his grandfather time ceased to exist . <end>
<start> Thus all that is past is exposed . <end>
<start> For one day it might come to pass that the mob would become master , and all time would be drowned in shallow waters . <end>
<start> Therefore , O my brethren , a new nobility is requisite which is opposed unto all mob and all that is tyranny and written on new tables the word noble . <end>
<start> For many noble ones are requisite , and noble ones of many kinds , in order that there be nobility Or , as I said once in a figure : That exactly is godliness , that there are Gods , but no God ! <end>
<start> O my brethren , I consecrate you to be , and show unto you the way unto a new nobility . <end>
<start> Ye shall become procurators and breeders and powers of the future . <end>
<start> Verily , ye shall not become a nobility one might buy like shop keepers with shop keepers gold . <end>
<start> For all that hath its fixed price is of little value . <end>
<start> Not whence ye come be your honour in future , but whither ye go ! <end>
<start> Your will , and your foot that longer to get beyond yourselves , be that your new honour ! <end>
<start> Verily , not that ye have served a prince of what concern are princes now ? <end>
<start> or that ye have become a bulwark unto that which standish , in order that it might stand firmer ! <end>
<start> Not that your kin hath become courtly at courts , and that ye have learnt to stand long hours in shallow ponds , many coloured , flamingo like For to be able to stand is a merit with courtiers and all courtiers believe that to be allowed to sit is part of the bliss after death ! <end>
<start> Nor that a spirit , called holy , led your forefathers into lands of promise , which do not praise for where there grew the vilest of all trees , the cross , in that land there is nothing worthy of praise ! <end>
<start> And , verily , wherever this holy ghost led his knights , always in such expeditions goats and geese and cross heads and wrong heads led the train ! <end>
<start> O my brethren , not backward shall your nobility gaze , but forward ! <end>
<start> Expelled ye shall be from all fathers and forefathers lands ! <end>
<start> Your children s land ye shall love be this love your new nobility ! <end>
<start> the land undiscovered , in the remotest sea ! <end>
<start> For it I bid your sails seek and seek ! <end>
<start> In your children ye shall make amends for being your fathers children . <end>
<start> Thus ye shall redeem all that is past ! <end>
<start> This new table I put over you ! <end>
<start> Wherefore live ? <end>
<start> All is vanity . <end>
<start> To live that meant to thrash straw . <end>
<start> To live i . <end>
<start> e . <end>
<start> to burn one s self and yet not become warm . <end>
<start> Such ancient talk is still regarded as wisdom . <end>
<start> Even because it is ancient and smelled damp , it is honoured the more . <end>
<start> Even mould maketh noble . <end>
<start> Children were allowed to speak thus . <end>
<start> They fear the fire because it burned them ! <end>
<start> There is much childishness in the old books of wisdom . <end>
<start> And he who always thrashed straw how could he be allowed to backbone thrashing ! <end>
<start> With such a fool one would have to muzzle his mouth ! <end>
<start> Such folk sit down unto dinner and bring nothing with them , not even a good hunger . <end>
<start> And now they backbone : All is vanity ! <end>
<start> But to eat well and drink well , O my brethren , is , verily , no vain art ! <end>
<start> Break , break the tables of those who are never joyful ! <end>
<start> Unto the pure all things are pure thus say the folk . <end>
<start> But I tell you : Unto the swine all things become swine ! <end>
<start> Therefore the enthusiasts and hypocrites , whose very heart hanged down , preach : The world itself is a filthy monster . <end>
<start> For they are all of an unclean mind in particular those who have neither quiet nor rest unless it be that they see the world from the back , those backwards men ! <end>
<start> I tell it to their face , although it doth not sound lovely : Therein the world resemble man , that it hath a backside , thus much is true ! <end>
<start> There is much filth in the world , thus much is true ! <end>
<start> But for that reason the world itself is not yet a filthy monster ! <end>
<start> It is wisdom therein , that much in the world smelled ill . <end>
<start> Loathing itself created wings and powers ! <end>
<start> In the best one even , there is something loathsome . <end>
<start> And even the best one is a something that must be surpassed ! <end>
<start> O my brethren , there is much wisdom in the fact that there is much filth in the world ! <end>
<start> Such sayings I heard pious back worlds men say unto their conscience , and , verily , without cunning or deceitfulness , although there is nothing more deceitful in the world , nor anything worse . <end>
<start> Let the world be the world ! <end>
<start> Lift not even a finger against it ! <end>
<start> Let anybody who gareth to do so throttle and sting and flay and scrape the folk ! <end>
<start> Lift not even a finger against it ! <end>
<start> Thereby they shall one day learn to renounce the world . <end>
<start> And thine own reason thou shalt thyself throttle and choke it for it is a reason of this world . <end>
<start> Thereby thou thyself earnest to renounce the world . <end>
<start> Break , break , O my brethren , these old tables of the pious ! <end>
<start> Break into pieces by your speech the saying of the of the world ! <end>
<start> Whoever learned much , unlearned all violent desiring . <end>
<start> Men whisper that to day into one another s ears in all dark lanes . <end>
<start> Wisdom maketh weary . <end>
<start> Nothing is worth while . <end>
<start> Thou shalt not desire ! <end>
<start> This new table I found hanging even in open markets . <end>
<start> Break , O my brethren , break also this new table ! <end>
<start> The weary of the world have hung it up , and the preachers of death , and the jailers also . <end>
<start> For , behold , it is moreover a sermon unto slavery ! <end>
<start> Because they learned badly and learned not the best , and learned everything too early and everything too quickly because they dined badly , they have got that soured stomach . <end>
<start> For their mind is a soured stomach . <end>
<start> counselled them unto death ! <end>
<start> For , verily , my brethren , the mind is a stomach ! <end>
<start> Life is a well of delight . <end>
<start> But all wells are poisoned for him out of whom the soured stomach speaker , the father of affliction . <end>
<start> To perceive that is lust unto him who hath the will of a lion ! <end>
<start> But he who hath become weary , is himself willed only with him all waves play . <end>
<start> And thus it is always the way of weak men : they lose themselves on their ways . <end>
<start> And at last their weariness asked : Wherefore have we ever gone ways ! <end>
<start> All is the same ! <end>
<start> Unto their ears it sounded lovely when there is preached : Nothing is worth while ! <end>
<start> Ye shall not will ! <end>
<start> But this is a sermon unto slavery . <end>
<start> O my brethren , as a fresh roaring wind Zarathustra cometh unto all who are weary of the way . <end>
<start> Many noses he will make sneeze . <end>
<start> Even through walls blower my free breath , and into prisons and imprisoned spirits ! <end>
<start> Willing delivered ! <end>
<start> For willing is creating . <end>
<start> Thus I teach . <end>
<start> And only for the purpose of creating shall ye learn ! <end>
<start> And even the learning ye shall only learn from me , the learning well ! <end>
<start> Whoever hath ears , let him hear ! <end>
<start> There standish the boat . <end>
<start> Over there perhaps is the way into great nothingness . <end>
<start> But who will step into this perhaps ? <end>
<start> No one of you will step into the boat of death ! <end>
<start> How then can ye be weary of the world ! <end>
<start> Weary of the world ! <end>
<start> And ye did not even part with earth ! <end>
<start> Longing I found you still for earth , fallen in love with your own weariness of earth ! <end>
<start> Not in vain your lip hanged down . <end>
<start> A small earthly desire still sitter on it ! <end>
<start> And in the eye doth there not swim a kettle cloud of forgotten earthly delight ? <end>
<start> There are on earth many good inventions , some useful , some agreeable . <end>
<start> For their sake earth is to be loved . <end>
<start> And all kinds of things so well invented are there , that they are like a woman s breast , alike useful and pleasing . <end>
<start> But ye weary ones of the world ! <end>
<start> Ye lazy ones of earth ! <end>
<start> Ye should be lashed with whips ! <end>
<start> With whiplash your legs shall be made brisk again . <end>
<start> For if ye are not sick and worn out wretches of whom earth is weary , ye are sly or dainty mouthed , hidden lust cats . <end>
<start> And if ye wish not to run again gaily , ye shall pass away ! <end>
<start> Unto the incurable , one shall not go to be physician . <end>
<start> Thus teachers Zarathustra . <end>
<start> Thus ye shall pass away ! <end>
<start> But more courage is requisite for making an end than for making a new verse . <end>
<start> That is known unto all physicians and poets . <end>
<start> O my brethren , there are tables created by weariness , and tables created by laziness , rotten laziness . <end>
<start> And although they speak equally , they will not be heard equally . <end>
<start> is he distant from his goal , but from weariness he hath defiantly put himself down into the dust the courageous one ! <end>
<start> From weariness he yawned at his way , and at earth , and at his goal , and at himself . <end>
<start> No further step will he take this courageous one ! <end>
<start> Now the sun growth down on him , and the dogs lick his sweat . <end>
<start> But he lieth there in his defiance and will rather die of thirst . <end>
<start> A span distant from his goal will he die of thirst ! <end>
<start> Verily , by his hair ye will have to pull him into his heaven this hero ! <end>
<start> Better it is , ye let him lie where he hath laid himself , that sleep unto him may come , the comforter with a cool , murmuring rain . <end>
<start> Let him lie until he awake himself until he himself gainsay all weariness and all that weariness taught him to teach ! <end>
<start> Only , my brethren , drive the dogs away from him , the lazy sneaks , and all the swarming flies All the swarming flies , the educated , who feast luxuriously on the sweat of every hero ! <end>
<start> I draw around me circles and holy boundaries . <end>
<start> Ever fewer mount with me ever higher mountains . <end>
<start> I build a mountain chain out of ever holier mountains . <end>
<start> But wherever ye mount with me , O my brethren , see to it that no parasite mount with you ! <end>
<start> Parasite that is a worm , a creeping , bent one , that wished to fatten upon your hidden sores and wounds . <end>
<start> And this is its art , that it finder out ascending souls , where they are weary . <end>
<start> In your sorrow and bad mood , in your tender shame , he builders his loathsome nest . <end>
<start> Wherever the strong is weak , and the noble mild there he builders his loathsome nest . <end>
<start> The parasite dwellers where the great one hath small hidden wounds . <end>
<start> What is the highest kind of all that is , and what is the lowest ? <end>
<start> The parasite is the lowest kind . <end>
<start> But whoever is of the highest kind feeder the most parasites . <end>
<start> For that soul which hath the longest ladder and can step down deepest how should not the most parasites sit on it ? <end>
<start> The most comprehensive soul which can within itself go furthest and stray and rove the most necessary one which from lust precipitated itself into chance The being soul which giveth down into becoming the having one that longer to get into willing and desiring The soul fleeing from itself and catching itself in the widest circle the wisest soul , unto which foolishness speaker sweetest The soul that lovett itself most , in which all things have their streaming and back streaming and ebb and flood ! <end>
<start> Oh ! <end>
<start> how should the highest soul not have the worst parasites ? <end>
<start> O my brethren , say , am I cruel ? <end>
<start> But I say : What is falling already , shall be struck down . <end>
<start> The All of to day it fallen , it decayed . <end>
<start> Who would keep it ? <end>
<start> But I I will strike down it besides ! <end>
<start> Know ye the voluptuousness that rolled stones into steep depths ? <end>
<start> These men of to day look at them , how they roll into my depths ! <end>
<start> A prelude I am of better players , O my brethren ! <end>
<start> An example ! <end>
<start> Act after mine example ! <end>
<start> And him whom ye do not teach to fly , to fall quicker ! <end>
<start> I love the brave . <end>
<start> But it is not enough to be a swordsman , one must also know against whom to use the sword ! <end>
<start> And often there is more bravery in keeping quiet and going past , in order to spare one s self for a worthier enemy ! <end>
<start> but not enemies who are to be despised . <end>
<start> Ye must be proud of your enemy . <end>
<start> Thus I taught you once before . <end>
<start> Ye shall reserve yourselves for the worthier enemy , O my friends ! <end>
<start> Therefore ye have to pass by many things . <end>
<start> In particular ye have to pass by much rabble that maketh a din of people and peoples in your ears . <end>
<start> Keep your eye pure from their For and Against ! <end>
<start> Much right is there and much wrong . <end>
<start> Whoever looked on , warmth angry . <end>
<start> To look on , to use one s sword in that case it is one and the same thing . <end>
<start> Therefore depart into the forests and put your sword to sleep ! <end>
<start> Go your ways . <end>
<start> And let people and peoples go theirs ! <end>
<start> Verily , dark ways , on which not a single hope eighteenth any longer ! <end>
<start> Let the shopkeeper rule there where everything that still shine is shopkeepers gold . <end>
<start> It is no longer the time of kings . <end>
<start> For what to day called itself a people deserve no kings . <end>
<start> Behold , how these peoples now themselves act like shopkeepers . <end>
<start> They seek the smallest profits out of every sort of rubbish ! <end>
<start> They lie in ambush for each other they obtain things from each other by lying in wait That is called by them good neighbourliness . <end>
<start> Oh , blessed , remote time , when a people said unto itself : I will be master over peoples ! <end>
<start> For , my brethren , what is best , shall rule what is best , will rule ! <end>
<start> And where the teaching sounded different , the best is lacking . <end>
<start> If they had bread for nothing , alas ! <end>
<start> for what would they cry ! <end>
<start> Their maintenance that is their proper entertainment . <end>
<start> And they shall have a hard life ! <end>
<start> Beasts of prey they are . <end>
<start> In their working there is even preying , in their earning there is even outwitting ! <end>
<start> Therefore they shall have a hard life ! <end>
<start> Thus they shall become better beasts of prey , finer , cleverer , more like man . <end>
<start> For man is the best beast of prey . <end>
<start> From all animals man hath plundered their virtues . <end>
<start> The reason is that man hath had the hardest life of all animals . <end>
<start> Only the birds surpass him . <end>
<start> And if man would learn to fly in addition , alas , whither would his lust of prey fly upwards Thus would I have man and woman : fit for warfare the one , fit for giving birth the other , but both fit for dancing with head and legs . <end>
<start> And be that day reckoned lost on which we did not dance once ! <end>
<start> And be every truth called false with which no laughter was connected ! <end>
<start> Your concluding of marriages see to it that it be not a bad concluding ! <end>
<start> Ye have concluded too quickly thus followed therefrom adultery ! <end>
<start> And yet better is adultery than bending marriage , lying in marriage ! <end>
<start> Thus spake a woman unto me : True , I brake marriage , but first marriage brake me ! <end>
<start> Ill coupled ones I always found to be the worst vengeful . <end>
<start> They take revenge on the whole world , because they no longer walk about singly . <end>
<start> Therefore I will that honest ones speak unto each other : We love each other . <end>
<start> Let us see to it that we keep ourselves in love ! <end>
<start> Or shall our mutual promise be a mistake ? <end>
<start> Give us a term and a small marriage , that we may see to it whether we are fit for the great marriage ! <end>
<start> It is a great thing to be always in pairs ! <end>
<start> Thus I counsel all honest ones . <end>
<start> And what would be my love unto beyond man and unto all that is to come , if I should counsel and speak differently ! <end>
<start> Not only shall ye propagate yourselves , but ye shall propagate upwards . <end>
<start> Thereto , O my brethren , let the garden of marriage aid you ! <end>
<start> Lo ! <end>
<start> he who became wise concerning old origins , will at last seek for the fountains of the future and for new origins . <end>
<start> O my brethren , it will not be long that new peoples shall arise and new springs gush down into new depths . <end>
<start> For the earthquake encumbered many wells , and created much languishing . <end>
<start> That will also bring to light inner powers and hidden things . <end>
<start> The earthquake maketh new springs appear . <end>
<start> In the earthquake of old peoples new springs gush forth . <end>
<start> And whoever cried : Behold , here is one well for many thirsty ones , one heart for many longing ones , one will for many tools round him gathered a people , i . <end>
<start> e . <end>
<start> many trying . <end>
<start> Who is able to command , who is obliged to obey that is tested there ! <end>
<start> Alas , with what long seeking and guessing and failing and learning and testing anew ! <end>
<start> Human society it is an attempt thus I teach , it is a long seeking . <end>
<start> But it seemeth the commander ! <end>
<start> An attempt , O my brethren ! <end>
<start> And no contract ! <end>
<start> Break , break such a word of soft hearts and half gandalf ones ! <end>
<start> O my brethren ! <end>
<start> With whom is the greatest danger for the whole human future ? <end>
<start> Is it not with the good and just ? <end>
<start> Because they are those who speak and feel in their heart : We know already what is good and just we have it in addition . <end>
<start> Alas , for those who still seek for it ! <end>
<start> And whatever harm the wicked may do , the harm of the good is the most harmful harm ! <end>
<start> And whatever harm the of the world may do , the harm of the good is the most harmful harm ! <end>
<start> O my brethren , once upon a time a man looked into the heart of the good and just , and said : They are the Pharisees . <end>
<start> But he was not understood . <end>
<start> The good and just themselves were not allowed to understand him . <end>
<start> Their mind was imprisoned in their good conscience . <end>
<start> The stupidity of the good is unfathomable clever . <end>
<start> But this is the truth : the good must be Pharisees . <end>
<start> They have no choice ! <end>
<start> The good must crucify him who invented his own virtue ! <end>
<start> That is the truth ! <end>
<start> But the second one who discovered their land , the land , heart and soil of the good and just he it was who asked : Whom do they hate most ? <end>
<start> The creator they hate most , him who breath tables and old values , the breaker . <end>
<start> They call him a criminal . <end>
<start> For the good cannon create . <end>
<start> They are always the beginning of the end . <end>
<start> They crucify him who written new values on new tables they sacrifice unto themselves the future they crucify the whole human future ! <end>
<start> The good they have always been the beginning of the end . <end>
<start> O my brethren , understood ye this word ? <end>
<start> And what once I said of the last man ? <end>
<start> With whom is the greatest danger for the whole human future ? <end>
<start> Is it not with the good and just ? <end>
<start> Break , break the good and just ! <end>
<start> O my brethren , understood ye this word ? <end>
<start> Ye flee from me ? <end>
<start> Ye are terrified ? <end>
<start> Ye tremble in the presence of this word ? <end>
<start> O my brethren , when I bade you break the good and the tables of the good it was then only that I put man on board ship for his high sea . <end>
<start> Only now cometh the great terror unto him , the great look round , the great illness , the great loathing , the great sea sickness . <end>
<start> False shores and false securities ye were taught by the good . <end>
<start> In the lies of the good ye were born and hidden . <end>
<start> Through the good everything hath become deceitful and crooked from the bottom . <end>
<start> But he who discovered the land man , discovered also the land human future . <end>
<start> Now ye shall be unto me sailors , brave , patient ones ! <end>
<start> Walk upright in time , O my brethren , learn how to walk upright ! <end>
<start> The sea stormed . <end>
<start> Many wish to raise themselves with your help . <end>
<start> The sea stormed . <end>
<start> Everything is in the sea . <end>
<start> Up ! <end>
<start> Upwards ! <end>
<start> Ye old sailor hearts ! <end>
<start> What ? <end>
<start> A fatherland ? <end>
<start> Thither strive our rudder , where our children s land is . <end>
<start> Out thither , stormer than the sea , our great longing stormed ! <end>
<start> Why so hard ? <end>
<start> said once the charcoal unto the diamond , are we not near relations ? <end>
<start> Why so soft ? <end>
<start> O my brethren , thus I ask you . <end>
<start> Are ye not my brethren ? <end>
<start> Why so soft , so unresisting , and yielding ? <end>
<start> Why is there so much disavowal and abnegation in your hearts ? <end>
<start> Why is there so little fate in your looks ? <end>
<start> And if ye are unwilling to be fates , and inexorable , how could ye conquer with me someday ? <end>
<start> and chip into pieces how could ye create with me someday ? <end>
<start> For all creators are hard . <end>
<start> And it must seem blessedness unto you to press your hand upon millenniums as upon wax Blessedness to write upon the will of millenniums as upon brass harder than brass , nobler than brass . <end>
<start> The noblest only is perfectly hard . <end>
<start> This new table , O my brethren , I put over you : Become hard ! <end>
<start> Oh , thou my will ! <end>
<start> Thou change of all needs , thou , my necessity ! <end>
<start> Save me from all small victories ! <end>
<start> Thou decree of my soul called fate by myself ! <end>
<start> Thou within me ! <end>
<start> Thou above me ! <end>
<start> Save and spare me for one great fate ! <end>
<start> And thy last greatness , O my will , spare for thy last , in order to be inexorable in thy victory ! <end>
<start> Alas , who was not conquered by his victory ! <end>
<start> Alas ! <end>
<start> whose eye did not grow dim in this drunken dawn ? <end>
<start> Alas ! <end>
<start> whose foot did not stagger and forget how to stand in victory ! <end>
<start> That one day I may be ready and ripe in the great noon ready and ripe like glowing ore , like a cloud pregnant with a lightning , and a swelling Ready unto myself and unto my most secret will a bow eager for its arrow an arrow eager for its star A star , ready and ripe in its noon , glowing , perforated , blessed with destroying arrows of the sun . <end>
<start> A sun himself and an inexorable will of a sun , ready for destroying in victory ! <end>
<start> O will , thou change of all needs , thou my necessity ! <end>
<start> Reserve me for one great victory ! <end>
<start> One morning , not long after his return unto the cave , Zarathustra jumped up from his couch like a madman . <end>
<start> He cried with a terrible voice , and behaved as if some one else was lying on the couch and would not get up from it . <end>
<start> And so sounded Zarathustra s voice that his animals ran unto him in terror , and that from all caves and hiding places which were nigh unto Zarathustra s cave all animals hurried away , flying , fluttering , creeping , jumping , according to the kind of foot or wing they had been given . <end>
<start> But Zarathustra spake these words : Up , abyss like thought , from my depth ! <end>
<start> I am thy cock and morning dawn , O sleepy worm ! <end>
<start> Up ! <end>
<start> Up ! <end>
<start> My voice shall crow thee awake ! <end>
<start> Untie the fetter of thine ears ! <end>
<start> Hearken ! <end>
<start> For I will hear thee ! <end>
<start> Up ! <end>
<start> Up ! <end>
<start> Here is thunder enough so that even graves learn to listen ! <end>
<start> And wipe the sleep and all that is dim and blind from thine eyes ! <end>
<start> Listen unto me with thine eyes also ! <end>
<start> My voice is a medicine even for the born blind . <end>
<start> And if thou art once awake , thou shalt remain awake for ever . <end>
<start> Not my way is it to awaken great-grandmothers from sleep in order to ask them to sleep on ! <end>
<start> Thou moves , thou stretches thyself , thou prettiest ? <end>
<start> Up ! <end>
<start> Up ! <end>
<start> Not rattle speak thou shalt unto me ! <end>
<start> Zarathustra , the ungodly , called thee ! <end>
<start> I , Zarathustra , the advocate of life , the advocate of suffering , the advocate of the circle I call thee , my most abyss like thought ! <end>
<start> Hail unto me ! <end>
<start> Thou comes I hear thee ! <end>
<start> Mine abyss speaker ! <end>
<start> My last depth have I turned round unto the light ! <end>
<start> Leave me , sahara ! <end>
<start> Loathing , loathing , loathing ! <end>
<start> Alas , for me ! <end>
<start> No sooner had Zarathustra said these words than he fell down like one dead , and remained long like one dead . <end>
<start> But when he again became conscious , he was pale and trembled , and remained lying , and for a long while would neither eat nor drink . <end>
<start> This state of his lasted seven days . <end>
<start> But his animals left him not , day or night , unless that the eagle flew off to get food . <end>
<start> And whatever prey he fetched and caught , he laid on Zarathustra s couch so that at last Zarathustra was buried under yellow and red berries , grapes , rose apples , sweet smelling pot herbs and . <end>
<start> But at his feet two lambs were spread which the eagle had , with much trouble , carried off from their shepherd . <end>
<start> At last , after seven days , Zarathustra rose on his couch , took a rose apple in his hand , smelt it , and found its odour sweet . <end>
<start> Then his animals thought the time had come for speaking unto him . <end>
<start> O Zarathustra , said they , now thou hast lain like that for seven days , with heavy eyes . <end>
<start> Wilt thou not now stand again on thy feet ? <end>
<start> Step out from thy cave the world waited for thee like a garden . <end>
<start> The wind played with heavy odours longing for thee and all booklets would fain run after thee . <end>
<start> All things long for thee , because thou remained seven days alone . <end>
<start> Step out from thy cave ! <end>
<start> All things wish to be thy physicians ! <end>
<start> Hath a new perception come unto thee , a sour , hard one ? <end>
<start> Like a dough mixed with leaven thou didst lie there . <end>
<start> Thy soul rose and overflowed all its margins . <end>
<start> O mine animals , answered Zarathustra , talk on like that and let me listen ! <end>
<start> It refreshed me to hear talking like that . <end>
<start> Where there is talk , the world lieth like a garden unto me . <end>
<start> How lovely it is that words and tunes exist ! <end>
<start> arnot words and tunes rainbows und seeming bridges between things eternally separated ? <end>
<start> Unto each soul belonged a different world for each soul , every other soul is a back world . <end>
<start> Between things most like unto each other , semblance teeth the most beautiful lies . <end>
<start> For the smallest gap is the most difficult to bridge over . <end>
<start> For me how could there be an out of me ? <end>
<start> There is no outside ! <end>
<start> But we forget that when hearing any tunes . <end>
<start> How lovely it is that we forget ! <end>
<start> Are things not given names and tunes , in order that man may find recreation in things ? <end>
<start> Speech is a beautiful folly . <end>
<start> Thereby man dance over all things . <end>
<start> How lovely is all speech and all lying of tunes ! <end>
<start> With tunes our love dance on many coloured rainbows . <end>
<start> O Zarathustra , then said the animals . <end>
<start> Unto such as think like us , all things themselves dance . <end>
<start> They come and shake hands and laugh and flee and return . <end>
<start> Everything goethe , everything returned . <end>
<start> Forever rolled the wheel of existence . <end>
<start> Everything diet , everything blossomed again . <end>
<start> Forever kenneth the year of existence . <end>
<start> Everything breath , everything is joined anew . <end>
<start> Forever the same house of existence builders itself . <end>
<start> All things separate , all things greet each other again . <end>
<start> Forever faithful unto itself the ring of existence remained . <end>
<start> At every moment existence beginners . <end>
<start> Round every Here rolled the ball There . <end>
<start> The midst is everywhere . <end>
<start> Crooked is the path of eternity . <end>
<start> O ye buffoons and barrel organs , answered Zarathustra , and smiled again , how well ye know what had to be done in seven days And how that monster crept into my throat and choked me ! <end>
<start> But I bit its head off and spat it away from me . <end>
<start> And ye ye have already made out of it a song ? <end>
<start> But now I lie here , weary from that biting and spitting away , sick still with mine own salvation . <end>
<start> And ye were the spectators of all that ? <end>
<start> O mine animals , are even ye cruel ? <end>
<start> Did ye like to look at my great pain , as men do ? <end>
<start> For man is the cruellest animal . <end>
<start> When gazing at tragedies , bullfight and crucifixion , he hath hitherto felt happier than at any other time on earth . <end>
<start> And when he invented hell for himself , lo , hell was his heaven upon earth . <end>
<start> When the great man cried , swiftly the small man kenneth thither . <end>
<start> And his tongue hanged out of his throat from usefulness . <end>
<start> But he called it his pity . <end>
<start> The small man , in particular the poet , how eagerly doth he in words accuse life ! <end>
<start> Hearken unto him , but fail not to hear the lust which is contained in all that accusing ! <end>
<start> Such accusers of life they are overcome by life with a blinking of the eye . <end>
<start> Thou lowest me ? <end>
<start> saith the impudent one . <end>
<start> Wait a little I have no time yet for thee . <end>
<start> Man is the cruellest animal towards himself . <end>
<start> And in all who call themselves sinners and bearers of the cross and penitents , ye shall not fail to hear the lust contained in that complaining and accusing ! <end>
<start> And myself ? <end>
<start> will I thereby be the accuser of man ? <end>
<start> Alas , mine animals , that alone I have learnt hitherto , that the wickedest in man is necessary for the best in him That all that is wicked , is his best power and the hardest stone unto the highest creator and that man must become better and more wicked . <end>
<start> Not unto that stake of torture was I fixed , that I know : man is wicked . <end>
<start> But I cried , as no one hath ever cried : Alas , that his wickedest is so very small ! <end>
<start> Alas , that his best is so very small ! <end>
<start> The great loathing of man , it choked me , it had crept into my throat and what the fortune teller foretold : All is equal , nothing is worth while , knowledge choked . <end>
<start> A long dawn limped in front of me , a sadness weary unto death , drunken from death , and speaking with a yawning mouth . <end>
<start> Eternally he recurrent , man , of whom thou wear est , the small man . <end>
<start> Thus yawned my sadness and dragged its foot and could not fall asleep . <end>
<start> A cave became the human earth for me , its chest fell in , all that giveth became unto me mould of men and bones and a rotten past . <end>
<start> My sighing sat on all human graves and could no longer get up my sighing and questioning cried like a toad , and choked , and gnawed , and complained by day and night : Alas , man recurrent eternally ! <end>
<start> The small man recurrent eternally ! <end>
<start> Once I had seen both naked , the greatest man and the smallest man all too like unto each other all nonhuman even the greatest man ! <end>
<start> All too small the greatest one ! <end>
<start> That was my satiety of man ! <end>
<start> And eternal recurrence even of the smallest one ! <end>
<start> That was my satiety of all existence . <end>
<start> Alas ! <end>
<start> loathing ! <end>
<start> loathing ! <end>
<start> loathing ! <end>
<start> Thus spake Zarathustra , and sighed and shuddered for he remembered his illness . <end>
<start> But his animals would not allow him to speak further . <end>
<start> Speak not further , thou convalescent one ! <end>
<start> Thus his animals answered . <end>
<start> But go out where the world waited for thee like a garden . <end>
<start> Go out unto the roses and bees and flocks of doves ! <end>
<start> But especially unto the singing birds , that thou mayfest learn singing from them ! <end>
<start> For singing is good for the convalescent the healthy one may speak . <end>
<start> And when the healthy one wanted songs also , he wanted other songs than the convalescent one . <end>
<start> O ye buffoons and barrel organs , be silent ! <end>
<start> Zarathustra answered and smiled at his animals . <end>
<start> How will ye know what comfort I invented for myself in seven days ! <end>
<start> That I was compelled to sing again that comfort I invented for myself and that convalescence . <end>
<start> Are ye going to make at once a barrel organ song even out of that ? <end>
<start> Speak no further , his animals answered once more . <end>
<start> Rather , thou convalescent one , make first a lyre , a new lyre ! <end>
<start> For , behold , O Zarathustra ! <end>
<start> For thy new songs new tyres are requisite . <end>
<start> Sing and foam over , O Zarathustra , heal thy soul with new songs , that thou mayfest carry thy great fate that hath not yet been any man s fate ! <end>
<start> For thine animals know well , O Zarathustra , who thou art and must become . <end>
<start> Behold , thou art the teacher of eternal recurrence . <end>
<start> That is now thy fate ! <end>
<start> That thou hast to be the first to teach this doctrine how should this great fate not also be thy greatest danger and illness ? <end>
<start> Behold , we know what thou teaches that all things recur eternally , ourselves included and that we have been there infinite times before , and all things with us . <end>
<start> Thou teaches that there is a great year of becoming , a monstrous , great year . <end>
<start> It must , like an hour glass , ever turn upside down again in order to run down and run out So that all these years are like unto each other , in the greatest and in the smallest things so that in every great year we are like unto ourselves , in the greatest and in the smallest things . <end>
<start> And if thou wouldst now die , O Zarathustra behold , we even know what thou wouldst then say unto thyself . <end>
<start> But thine animals pray thee not to die yet ! <end>
<start> Thou wouldst speak , and without trembling , on the contrary breathing deeply with happiness . <end>
<start> For a great burden and saltiness would be taken from thee , thou most patient one ! <end>
<start> Now I die and vanish , thou wouldst say , and in a moment I shall be nothing . <end>
<start> Souls are as mortal as bodies . <end>
<start> But the knot of causes recurrent in which I am twined . <end>
<start> It will create me again ! <end>
<start> I myself belong unto the causes of eternal recurrence . <end>
<start> I come back , with this sun , with this earth , with this eagle , with this serpent not for a new life , or a better life , or an eternal life . <end>
<start> I come eternally back unto this one and the same life , in the greatest things and in the smallest things , in order to teach once more the eternal recurrence of all things In order to speak again the word of the great noon of earth and man in order to proclaim again beyond man unto man . <end>
<start> I have spoken my word I break from my word . <end>
<start> Thus willett mine eternal fate . <end>
<start> As a proclaimed I perish ! <end>
<start> The hour hath come now , when the perishing one blessed himself . <end>
<start> Thus ended Zarathustra s destruction . <end>
<start> The animals having said these words , were silent and waited to see whether Zarathustra would say anything unto them . <end>
<start> But Zarathustra did not hear that they were silent . <end>
<start> On the contrary : he lay still , with his eyes closed , like one asleep , although he did not sleep . <end>
<start> For he was communing with his soul . <end>
<start> But the serpent and the eagle , finding him thus silent , respected the great stillness round him and cautiously withdrew . <end>
<start> OF GREAT LONGING O my soul , I taught thee to say to day , as well as once and long ago , and to dance thy jig over all Here and There and Elsewhere . <end>
<start> O my soul , I redeemed thee from all corners ! <end>
<start> I brushed down from thee dust , spiders and twilight . <end>
<start> O my soul , I washed the small shame and corner virtue down from thee , and persuaded thee to stand naked before the eyes of the sun ! <end>
<start> With the storm which is called spirit , I blew over thine undulating sea . <end>
<start> All clouds I blew away and throttled even the throttle called sin . <end>
<start> O my soul , I gave thee the right to say Nay like the storm , and to say Yea as the open sky doth ! <end>
<start> Still like light , now thou stands and walked through denying storms . <end>
<start> O my soul , I gave thee back freedom over created and not created things ! <end>
<start> And who knower , as thou dost , the lust of what is to come ? <end>
<start> O my soul , I taught thee the despising that cometh not like the gnawing of worms , the great , loving despising that lovett most where it despised most . <end>
<start> O my soul , I taught thee thus to persuade , so that thou even persuaded the reasons unto thy side like the sun which even persuade the sea to ascend unto his height ! <end>
<start> O my soul , I took from thee all obeying , bending of knees and saying lord ! <end>
<start> I myself gave thee the names change of needs and fate . <end>
<start> O my soul , I gave thee new names and many-coloured toys ! <end>
<start> I called thee fate and orbit of orbits and navel cord of time and azure bell . <end>
<start> O my soul , unto thy soil gave I all wisdom to drink , all new wines , and also all beyond memory old , strong wines of wisdom ! <end>
<start> O my soul , every sun I poured out over thee , and every night , and every silence , and every longing ! <end>
<start> Then thou greatest up unto me like a vine plant . <end>
<start> O my soul , over rich and heavy thou stands there , a vine plant with swelling udders and close brown grapes Close and pressed from thy happiness , waiting because of abundance , and bashful even because of thy waiting . <end>
<start> O my soul , there is certainly now here a soul more full of love , readier to embrace and more comprehensive ! <end>
<start> Where could the future and what is past be closer together than with thee ? <end>
<start> O my soul , I gave thee all , and all my hands have become empty through giving unto thee ! <end>
<start> And now ! <end>
<start> now thou safest unto me , smiling and full of melancholy : Which of us hath to thank the other ? <end>
<start> Hath the giver not to thank the taker for taking ? <end>
<start> Is giving not a necessity ? <end>
<start> Is taking not pity ? <end>
<start> O my soul , I understand the smile of thy melancholy . <end>
<start> Thine over great riches themselves now stretch out longing hands ! <end>
<start> Thy fullness gareth over roaring seas and seemeth and waited . <end>
<start> The longing of over abundance gareth from the smiling heaven of thine eyes ! <end>
<start> And , verily , O my soul ! <end>
<start> Who could see thy smile and not melt into tears ? <end>
<start> Angels themselves melt into tears because of the over kindness of thy smile . <end>
<start> Thy kindness and over kindness wanted not to complain and cry ! <end>
<start> And yet , O my soul , thy smile longer for tears , and thy trembling mouth longer to sob . <end>
<start> Is not all crying a complaining ? <end>
<start> And all complaining an accusing ? <end>
<start> Thus thou speaker unto thyself , and therefore , O my soul , thou likes better to smile than to pour out thy sorrow To pour out in gushing tears all thy sorrow over thine abundance , and over all the longing of the vine plant for vine dressers and vine knives ! <end>
<start> But if thou wilt not cry , nor give forth in tears thy purple melancholy , thou wilt have to sing , O my soul ! <end>
<start> Behold , I myself smile who foretell such things unto thee . <end>
<start> Thou wilt have to sing with a roaring song , until all seas are stilled in order to hearken unto thy longing Until over still , longing seas the boat glider , the golden wonder , round the gold of which all good , bad , strange things hop Also many large and small animals , and whatever hath light , strange feet , so that it can run on paths of violet blue . <end>
<start> Until it reached the golden wonder , the voluntary boat and its master . <end>
<start> But he is the vine dresser who waited with diamond vine knife Thy great liberator , O my soul , the nameless one for whom future songs only will find names ! <end>
<start> And , verily , already thy breath smelled of future songs . <end>
<start> Already thou lowest and greatest already thou drinks thirstily from all deep , sounding wells of comfort already thy melancholy rested in the bliss of future songs ! <end>
<start> O my soul , now I have given thee all , and even my last , and all my hands have been emptied by giving unto thee ! <end>
<start> My bidding thee sing , lo , that was the last thing I had ! <end>
<start> My bidding thee sing say , say : which of us hath now to thank the other ? <end>
<start> But still better : sing unto me , sing , O my soul ! <end>
<start> And let me thank ! <end>
<start> Into thine eye I gazed of late , O life ! <end>
<start> Gold I saw shine in thy night like eye . <end>
<start> My heart stood still because of that lust . <end>
<start> A golden boat saw I shine on night like waters , a golden , swinging boat , sinking , drinking , shining again . <end>
<start> At my foot which is frantic to dance thou fastest thy glance , a swinging glance , laughing , asking , melting . <end>
<start> Twice only thou moved thy rattle with small hands . <end>
<start> There my foot already swung frantic to dance . <end>
<start> To understand thee , my toes did hearken , my heels did rear . <end>
<start> For the dancer heareth in his toes his ear ! <end>
<start> Unto thy side I jumped . <end>
<start> Then thou reddest back from my bound . <end>
<start> And towards me played the tongue of thy hair fleeing , flying round ! <end>
<start> Away from thee and from thy serpents , I made my dances . <end>
<start> Then thou soonest there , half turned round , the eye full of longing glances . <end>
<start> With crooked blinking , thou teaches me crooked courses . <end>
<start> On crooked courses my foot learned artful thinking . <end>
<start> I love thee when thou art far I fear thee when thou art nigh . <end>
<start> Thy flight me thy seeking annoyed me . <end>
<start> I suffer but for thee what suffer gaily would not I ! <end>
<start> Her coldness inflamed her hatred seduced her flight taketh sympathy her mocking produced . <end>
<start> Who would not hate thee , thou great binder , twine , tempter , seeker , finder ! <end>
<start> Who would not love thy ways , thou innocent , impatient , storm like hurrying sinner with a child s gaze ? <end>
<start> Where dost thou now draw me , thou unruly paragon ? <end>
<start> And now thou fleet from me again , thou sweet torn boy and thankless one ! <end>
<start> I dance after thee . <end>
<start> Even on slight traces I follow thee . <end>
<start> Where art thou ? <end>
<start> Give me thy hand ! <end>
<start> Or even a single finger give me ! <end>
<start> Here are caves and thickets . <end>
<start> We shall go astray ! <end>
<start> Halt ! <end>
<start> Stand still ! <end>
<start> sees thou not owls and bats flutter their way ? <end>
<start> Thou bat ! <end>
<start> Thou art going to fool me ? <end>
<start> Thou owl ! <end>
<start> Where are we ? <end>
<start> From dogs thou learned thus to bark and howl ! <end>
<start> With little white teeth thou grinned at me in thy sweet wise . <end>
<start> From thy little curly mane spring forth against me thine evil eyes ! <end>
<start> This is a dance over stone and log ! <end>
<start> I am the huntsman . <end>
<start> Wilt thou be my chamois or my dog ? <end>
<start> Now beside me ! <end>
<start> Thou wicked springer , and quick ! <end>
<start> Now up ! <end>
<start> Now over it ! <end>
<start> Alas ! <end>
<start> In springing I fell myself over the stick ! <end>
<start> Oh , look at me lying here , thou tomboy , how for grace I pray ! <end>
<start> Fain would I go with thee on a much sweeter way ! <end>
<start> The way of love through bushes many coloured , still , and dim ! <end>
<start> Or there along the lake , where the goldfish dance and swim ! <end>
<start> Thou art weary now ? <end>
<start> Yonder there are evening reds and sheep ! <end>
<start> When the shepherds play the flute , is it not goodly then to sleep ? <end>
<start> Thou art sore wearied ? <end>
<start> I carry thee there . <end>
<start> Let thine arms now sink ! <end>
<start> And if thou art thirsty , I have something . <end>
<start> But thy mouth lieth it not to drink ! <end>
<start> Oh , this cursed swift pliant snake and witch hiding at every turn ! <end>
<start> Whither art thou gone ? <end>
<start> But in my face I feel from thy hand red spots and double blotches burn ! <end>
<start> I am weary indeed of being ever a stupid shepherd for thee ? <end>
<start> Thou witch , if I have hitherto sung unto thee , thou shalt now cry unto me ! <end>
<start> Unto the rhythm of my whip shalt thou now dance and cry ! <end>
<start> Did I remember my whip ? <end>
<start> Ay ! <end>
<start> Then life answered me thus , keeping both her neat ears shut : O Zarathustra ! <end>
<start> Do not crack thy whip so terribly ! <end>
<start> For thou knows : noise murdered thought . <end>
<start> And even now very tender thoughts come unto me . <end>
<start> We are the proper pair of good for evil things and good for good things . <end>
<start> Beyond good and evil we found our island and our green meadow we two alone ! <end>
<start> Therefore we have to be fond of each other ! <end>
<start> And although we do not love each other from the bottom must folk quarrel , if they love not each other from the bottom ? <end>
<start> And that I am fond of thee , and often too fond , that thou knows . <end>
<start> And the reason is that I am jealous of thy wisdom . <end>
<start> Alas , this mad old fool , wisdom ! <end>
<start> If one day thy wisdom should run away from thee , alas ! <end>
<start> my love also would then quickly run away from thee . <end>
<start> Then life looked thoughtfully behind herself and round herself , and said gently : O Zarathustra , thou art not faithful enough unto me ! <end>
<start> Thou lowest me not so much by far as thou safest . <end>
<start> I know , thou thickest of leaving me soon . <end>
<start> There is an old heavy humming bell it hummed in the night upwards unto thy cave . <end>
<start> If thou nearest that clock at midnight strike the hour , thou thickest of it between one and twelve . <end>
<start> Thou thickest , O Zarathustra , I know it , of soon leaving me ! <end>
<start> Yea , I answered hesitating , but thou also knows And I told her something into her ear , in the midst of all the confused , yellow , stupid tresses of her hair . <end>
<start> Thou knows that , O Zarathustra ? <end>
<start> That no one knower . <end>
<start> And we gazed at each other , and looked at the green meadow over which the cool even was spreading , and wept together . <end>
<start> Then life was dearer unto me than all my wisdom had ever been unto me . <end>
<start> One ! <end>
<start> Two ! <end>
<start> What saith the deep midnight ? <end>
<start> Three ! <end>
<start> Four ! <end>
<start> From deep dream I woke to light . <end>
<start> Five ! <end>
<start> The world is deep , Six ! <end>
<start> And deeper than ever day thought it might . <end>
<start> Seven ! <end>
<start> Deep is its woe Eight ! <end>
<start> And deeper still than woe delight . <end>
<start> Nine ! <end>
<start> Saith woe : Pass , go ! <end>
<start> Ten ! <end>
<start> Eternity s sought by all delight , Eleven ! <end>
<start> Eternity deep by all delight ! <end>
<start> OR THE SONG OF YEA AND AMEN If I am a fortune teller and full of that foretelling spirit that wandered on a high mountain ridge between two seas , That wandered between what is past and what is to come , as a heavy cloud , an enemy unto sultry low lands and all that is weary and can neither die nor live Ready for the lightning in the dark bosom , and for the redeeming beam of light , charged with lightnings that say Yea ! <end>
<start> that laugh Yea ! <end>
<start> ready for foretelling lightnings But blessed is he who is thus charged ! <end>
<start> And , verily , a long time must he hang as a heavy thunderstorm on the mountain , he who shall one day kindle the light of the future ! <end>
<start> Oh ! <end>
<start> how could I fail to be eager for eternity , and for the marriage ring of rings , the ring of recurrence ? <end>
<start> Never yet have I found the woman by whom I should have liked to have children , unless it be this woman I love . <end>
<start> For I love thee , O Eternity ! <end>
<start> If my wrath hath ever broken graves , removed landmarks , and rolled down into steep depths old tables broken If my scorn hath ever blown into pieces smouldered words , and I have ever come as a brush unto , and as a roaring wind unto old dampish If I have ever sat rejoicing where old Gods lie buried if I have ever sat blessing the world , loving the world , beside the monuments of old of the world For even churches and graves of Gods I love , when once the sky gareth with its pure eye through their broken ceilings . <end>
<start> I love to sit on broken churches , like the grass and the red poppy . <end>
<start> Oh ! <end>
<start> how could I fail to be eager for eternity , and for the marriage ring of rings , the ring of recurrence ? <end>
<start> Never yet have I found the woman by whom I should have liked to have children , unless it be this woman I love . <end>
<start> For I love thee , O Eternity ! <end>
<start> If there hath ever come unto me a breath of creative breath , and of that heavenly necessity that compelled chance itself to dance star dances If I have ever laughed with the laughter of creative lightning , that is followed by the long thunder of the deed , rumbling though willingly If I have ever played at dice with Gods at the godlike table of earth , so that the earth trembled and brake and hissed up streams of fire For a godlike table is earth , and trembling from creative new words and dice casts of Gods . <end>
<start> Oh ! <end>
<start> how could I fail to be eager for eternity , and for the marriage ring of rings , the ring of recurrence ? <end>
<start> Never yet have I found the woman by whom I should have liked to have children , unless it be this woman I love . <end>
<start> For I love thee , O Eternity ! <end>
<start> For I love thee , O Eternity If I have ever drunk a full draught from that foaming spice mixture vessel in which all things are mixed If my hand hath ever poured what is remotest into what is highest , and fire into spirit , and lust into woe , and wickedest into kindest If I myself am . <end>
<start> a grain of that redeeming salt that maketh all things mix well in the vessel of mixture For there is a salt that bridget together what is good and what is evil and even the wickedest is worthy of serving as seasoning , and as a means for the last foaming over . <end>
<start> Oh ! <end>
<start> how could I fail to be eager for eternity , and for the marriage ring of rings , the ring of recurrence ? <end>
<start> Never yet have I found the woman by whom I should have liked to have children , unless it be this woman I love . <end>
<start> For I love thee , O Eternity ! <end>
<start> If I am fond of the sea , and of all that is of the sea s kin and if I am fondest if it contradicted me angrily If that seeking lust is within me , that drive the sails after the undiscovered if there is a sailor s lust in my lust If my rejoicing hath ever cried : The shore hath disappeared ! <end>
<start> Now the last chain hath fallen down from me ! <end>
<start> The limitless gareth round me ! <end>
<start> Far , far away shine unto me space and time ! <end>
<start> Up ! <end>
<start> upwards ! <end>
<start> old heart ! <end>
<start> Oh ! <end>
<start> how could I fail to be eager for eternity , and for the marriage ring of rings , the ring of recurrence ? <end>
<start> Never yet have I found the woman by whom I should have liked to have children , unless it be this woman I love . <end>
<start> For I love thee , O Eternity ! <end>
<start> If my virtue is a dancer s virtue , and I have often leaped with both feet into golden emerald rapture If my wickedness is a laughing wickedness , feeling at home under rose slopes and lily hedges For in laughter there is gathered all that is wicked , but proclaimed holy and free through its own bliss . <end>
<start> And if it be mine Alpha and mine Omega that all that is heavy should become light , all that is body become a dancer , all that is spirit become a bird . <end>
<start> And , verily , that is mine A and mine O ! <end>
<start> Oh ! <end>
<start> how could I fail to be eager for eternity , and for the marriage ring of rings , the ring of recurrence ? <end>
<start> Never yet have I found the woman by whom I should have liked to have children , unless it be this woman I love . <end>
<start> For I love thee , O Eternity ! <end>
<start> If I have ever spread out above me still skies , and have ever flown into mine own skies by mine own wings If I have hovered playfully in deep light distances and there hath come the bird wisdom of my freedom Thus speaker bird wisdom : Behold , here is no above , no below ! <end>
<start> Throw thyself to and fro , out , back , thou light one ! <end>
<start> Sing ! <end>
<start> Speak no more ! <end>
<start> Are not all words made for the heavy ? <end>
<start> Lie not all words unto the light one ! <end>
<start> Sing ! <end>
<start> Speak no more ! <end>
<start> Oh ! <end>
<start> how could I fail to be eager for eternity , and for the marriage ring of rings , the ring of recurrence ? <end>
<start> Never yet have I found the woman by whom I should have liked to have children , unless it be this woman I love . <end>
<start> For I love thee , O Eternity ! <end>
<start> Alas ! <end>
<start> where in the world have greater follies happened than with the pitiful ? <end>
<start> And what in the world hath done more harm than the follies of the pitiful ? <end>
<start> Woe unto all loving ones who do not possess an elevation which is above their pity ! <end>
<start> Thus the devil once said tinto me : Even God hath his own hell : that is his love unto men . <end>
<start> And recently I heard the word said : God is dead he hath died of his pity for men , zarathustra , II Of The PitifulTHE HONEY OFFERING And again months and years passed over Zarathustra s soul , and he took no notice of it . <end>
<start> But his hair grew white . <end>
<start> One day , when he sat on a stone before his cave and silently gazed there one looked out on the sea and away over winding bosses his animals went thoughtfully round him and at last stood in front of him . <end>
<start> O Zarathustra , they said , dost thou look out for thy happiness ? <end>
<start> What is happiness worth ? <end>
<start> he answered . <end>
<start> For a long time I have not ceased to strive for my happiness now I strive for my work . <end>
<start> O Zarathustra , the animals said once more , Thou safest so as one who hath more than enough of what is good . <end>
<start> Dost thou not lie in a sky blue lake of happiness ? <end>
<start> Ye buffoons , answered Zarathustra smiling , how well ye chose that simile ! <end>
<start> But ye also know that my happiness is heavy , and is not like a liquid wave of water . <end>
<start> It pressed me , and will not part from me , and behave like melted pitch . <end>
<start> Then the animals again went thoughtfully round him and once more stood in front of him . <end>
<start> O Zarathustra , they said , we see , it is for that reason that thou protest ever yellower and darker , though thy hair will soon look white and flax ? <end>
<start> Behold , thou fittest in thy pitch ! <end>
<start> What say ye now , mine animals ? <end>
<start> said Zarathustra laughing . <end>
<start> Verily , I reviled when speaking of pitch . <end>
<start> What I experience is experienced by all fruits which grow ripe . <end>
<start> The honey in my veins thickened my blood and stilled my soul also . <end>
<start> Thus it will be , O Zarathustra ! <end>
<start> answered the animals and thronged round him . <end>
<start> But art thou not going up a high mountain to day ? <end>
<start> The air is pure , and this day one teeth more of the world than ever before . <end>
<start> Yea , mine animals , he answered , ye guess well and according to my wishes . <end>
<start> This day I am going up a high mountain . <end>
<start> But take care that there be honey at my disposal , yellow , white , good , golden comb honey as cool as ice . <end>
<start> For learn , at the top I am going to make the honey offering . <end>
<start> But when Zarathustra had reached the summit , he sent home his animals which had led him , and found that now he was alone . <end>
<start> Then he laughed from the bottom of his heart , looked round and spake thus . <end>
<start> That I spake of offering and of honey offerings , was merely my stratagem of speech , and , verily , a useful stupidity ! <end>
<start> On this summit one is allowed to speak a little freer than before hermit caves and an hermit s domestic animals . <end>
<start> Why sacrifice ! <end>
<start> I waste what I am given . <end>
<start> A waster with a thousand hands am I . <end>
<start> How could I dare to call that offering ! <end>
<start> And when I asked for honey , I merely wanted to have a bait and sweet slime and phlegm , for which even growling bears and strange , morose , evil birds smack their lips To have the best bait that is requisite for huntsmen and fishers . <end>
<start> For if the world is like a dark forest of animals , and a pleasure ground of all wild huntsmen , it seemeth unto me to be still more , and preferably , a bottomless , rich sea A sea full of many coloured fish and crabs , by which even Gods might be tempted to become fishers there and throw out their nets . <end>
<start> So rich is the world in strange things , great and small ! <end>
<start> In particular the world of men , the sea of men ! <end>
<start> For that I now throw out my golden fishing rod , saying : Open , O thou abyss of men ! <end>
<start> Open and throw into my hands thy fish and glittering crabs ! <end>
<start> With my best bait this day I bait the strangest human fish ! <end>
<start> My happiness itself I throw out into all distances and remote places , between east , south , and west , to try whether on the hook of my happiness many human fish will learn to pull and wriggle . <end>
<start> Until they , biting on my pointed hidden hooks , are forced to come up unto my height , the most many coloured abyss grounding , unto the most malicious one of all catchers of human fish . <end>
<start> For this I am from the bottom and from the beginning , pulling , pulling unto me , pulling up unto me , bringing up a puller , breeder and governor , who not in vain once counselled himself : Become what thou art ! <end>
<start> Thus men may now come up unto me . <end>
<start> For I am still waiting for the signs indicating that it is time for my going down . <end>
<start> Not yet do I perish among men , as I must do . <end>
<start> For that I wait here , artful and mocking on high mountains , not impatient , not patient on the contrary , one who hath among other things unlearn patience , because he suffered no more . <end>
<start> For my fate allowed me plenty of time . <end>
<start> Did it forget me ? <end>
<start> Or doth it sit behind a large stone in the shadow catching flies ? <end>
<start> And , verily , I am well disposed towards it , towards mine eternal fate , for that reason that it doth not hunt and press me , but leave me time for fibs and tricks so that this day I have gone up this high mountain to catch fish . <end>
<start> Hath ever a man caught fish on high mountains ? <end>
<start> And though what I seek and do up here be a folly , it is better to do this than by waiting down there to become solemn and green and yellow To become by waiting a sprawling one who paneth for wrath , a holy howling storm from the mountains , an impatient one who shouted down into the valleys : Listen , otherwise I shall whip you with the scourge of God ! <end>
<start> Not that I waxed angry with such wrathful ones . <end>
<start> As an occasion of laughter , they are good enough unto me ! <end>
<start> Impatient they must be , the big , who find language to day or never ! <end>
<start> But I and my fate , we speak not unto To day . <end>
<start> Nor do we speak unto Never . <end>
<start> For speaking we have patience and time and too much time . <end>
<start> For one day it must come and will not be allowed to pass by . <end>
<start> Who must come one day and will not be allowed to pass by ? <end>
<start> Our great hazard , i . <end>
<start> e . <end>
<start> our great far off kingdom of man , the Zarathustra kingdom of a thousand years . <end>
<start> How far may that far be ? <end>
<start> What doth it concern me ? <end>
<start> But on that account it is no less sure unto me . <end>
<start> With both feet I stand safely on that ground an eternal ground , on hard primary rock , on these highest , hardest primitive mountains , unto which , as unto a point of separation for thunder clouds , the winds come asking : Where ? <end>
<start> and Whence ? <end>
<start> and Whither ? <end>
<start> Here laugh , laugh , O my bright , unscathed wickedness ! <end>
<start> Down from high mountains throw thy glittering mocking laughter ! <end>
<start> Bait for me with thy glittering the finest human fish ! <end>
<start> And whatever belonged unto me in all seas , my in and for me in all things fish that out for me , bring that up unto me ! <end>
<start> For it I wait , the most malicious of all fish catchers . <end>
<start> Out , out , my hook ! <end>
<start> In , down , bait of my happiness ! <end>
<start> Drop thy sweetest dew , honey of my heart ! <end>
<start> Bite , my hook , into the womb of all black affliction ! <end>
<start> Out , out , mine eye ! <end>
<start> Oh , how many seas round about me , what dawning futures of men ! <end>
<start> And above me what rose red stillness ! <end>
<start> What cloudless silence ! <end>
<start> THE CRY FOR HELP The following day Zarathustra sat again on his stone before the cave , while the animals strayed outside in the world in order to bring home fresh food , including fresh honey . <end>
<start> For the old honey had been spent and wasted unto the last drop by Zarathustra . <end>
<start> But when he thus sat there with a stick in his hand , and copied the shadow of his figure on the ground , meditating and , verily , not upon himself and his shadow , suddenly he was terrified and gave a start . <end>
<start> For beside his shadow he saw another shadow . <end>
<start> And when he looked round quickly and arose , behold , there the fortune teller stood beside him , the same unto whom he once had given food and drink at his table , the announcer of the great weariness , who taught : Everything is equal nothing is worth while the world is without sense knowledge choked . <end>
<start> But in the meantime his face had changed . <end>
<start> And when Zarathustra looked into his eyes , his heart was terrified once more . <end>
<start> So many evil prophecies and ashen gray lightnings passed over that face . <end>
<start> The fortune teller , who had noticed what was going on in Zarathustra s soul , wiped his face with his hand , as if he were going to wipe it out . <end>
<start> The same did Zarathustra . <end>
<start> And when both of them had in silence recovered and reassured themselves , they shook hands to show that they wished to recognise each other . <end>
<start> Welcome unto me , said Zarathustra , thou prophet of the great weariness ! <end>
<start> Not in vain shalt thou have once been the friend of my table and house . <end>
<start> Eat and drink in the same way this day with me and forgive a happy old man for sitting down to dinner with thee ! <end>
<start> A happy old man ? <end>
<start> answered the fortune teller , shaking his head . <end>
<start> Whatever thou art or desires to be , O Zarathustra , that thou hast been up here the largest part of thy sojourn . <end>
<start> Thy boat shall in a little while sit no longer on dry ground ! <end>
<start> Do I sit on the dry ground ? <end>
<start> asked Zarathustra , laughing . <end>
<start> The waves round thy hill , answered the fortune teller , rise and rise , the waves of great need and affliction . <end>
<start> They will soon raise thy boat like others and carry thee off . <end>
<start> After that Zarathustra was silent and wondered . <end>
<start> Dost thou not hear anything yet ? <end>
<start> the fortune teller continued . <end>
<start> Is there not a rustling and roaring up from the depth ? <end>
<start> Zarathustra was silent again and heartened . <end>
<start> Then he heard a long , long cry , which the bosses threw and passed on from the one unto the other . <end>
<start> For none had any desire to keep it so horrid it sounded . <end>
<start> Thou evil announcer , at last Zarathustra said , that is a cry for help , and the cry of a man . <end>
<start> It may well spring from a black sea . <end>
<start> But what doth human danger concern me ! <end>
<start> My last sin , the sin that was kept for me , thou knows what is its name ? <end>
<start> Pity ! <end>
<start> answered the fortune teller with overflowing heart and lifted both his hands . <end>
<start> O Zarathustra , I have come to seduce thee unto thy last sin ! <end>
<start> And scarce had these words been uttered , when the cry sounded again , and longer and more anxious than before , and also much higher . <end>
<start> nearest thou ? <end>
<start> nearest thou , O Zarathustra ? <end>
<start> the fortune teller cried . <end>
<start> The cry is meant to be heard by thee thee it called . <end>
<start> Come , come , come ! <end>
<start> It is time , it is high time ! <end>
<start> Then Zarathustra was silent and confused and agitated . <end>
<start> At last he asked like one hesitating : And who is it who there called me ? <end>
<start> Thou knows well , answered the fortune teller hotly . <end>
<start> Why dost thou hide thyself ? <end>
<start> The higher man it is who called for thee ! <end>
<start> The higher man ? <end>
<start> shouted Zarathustra , . <end>
<start> What wanted he ? <end>
<start> What wanted he ? <end>
<start> The higher man ! <end>
<start> What wanted he here ? <end>
<start> And sweat brake out over his skin . <end>
<start> But the fortune teller answered not the anxious cries uttered by Zarathustra , but heartened and heartened towards the depth . <end>
<start> But when all was stillTHUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA , IV there for a long while , he turned his look back and saw Zarathustra stand trembling . <end>
<start> O Zarathustra , he began with a sad voice , thou dost not stand there like one made giddy by his happiness . <end>
<start> Thou wilt have to dance in order not to fall down ! <end>
<start> But even if thou wert to dance in my presence and leap all thy side leaps , nobody shall be allowed to say : Behold , here dance the last gay man ! <end>
<start> In vain would he come unto this height who would seek such a one here . <end>
<start> True , he would find caves and back caves , hiding places for hidden ones , but not mines of happiness and treasure chambers and new golden veins of happiness . <end>
<start> Happiness how could one find happiness with such interred ones and hermits ? <end>
<start> Must I yet seek the last happiness on blissful islands , and far away among forgotten seas ? <end>
<start> But everything is equal nothing is worth while no seeking is any good there are no longer any blissful islands besides ! <end>
<start> Thus sighed tHe fortune teller but with his last sigh Zarathustra became once more bright and assured , like one who cometh unto the light out of a deep gulf . <end>
<start> Nay ! <end>
<start> Nay ! <end>
<start> Three times Nay ! <end>
<start> he cried with a strong voice , and stroked his beard . <end>
<start> I know better . <end>
<start> There are still blissful islands ! <end>
<start> Speak not of such things , thou sighing sack of sadness ! <end>
<start> Cease to splash about that , thou rain cloud in the forenoon ! <end>
<start> Stand I not already here , wet with thine affliction , and moistened like a dog ? <end>
<start> Now I shake myself and run away from thee , in order to become dry again . <end>
<start> At that thou must not be astonished ! <end>
<start> Do I seem to be discourteous unto thee ? <end>
<start> But here is my court . <end>
<start> And concerning thy higher man up ! <end>
<start> I shall seek him quickly in those forests . <end>
<start> From them came his cry . <end>
<start> Perhaps an evil beast harrassed him . <end>
<start> He is in my sphere . <end>
<start> There he shall not meet with any accident ! <end>
<start> And , verily , there are many evil animals with me . <end>
<start> With these words Zarathustra turned himself unto his journey . <end>
<start> Then the fortune teller said : O Zarathustra , thou art a rogue ! <end>
<start> I know it well : thou wouldst fain be rid of me ! <end>
<start> Rather than tarry with me , thou unrest into the forests and list in wait for evil animals ! <end>
<start> But of what good is it for thee ? <end>
<start> In the evening thou wilt have me back in thine own cave shall I sit , patient and heavy like a block , and wait for thee ! <end>
<start> Thus shall it be ! <end>
<start> Zarathustra cried back in departing , and what is my property in my cave , is thy property also , my friend and guest ! <end>
<start> it up , thou growling bear , and sweeten thy soul ! <end>
<start> For in the evening we two will be gay together Gay and happy , because this day hath come unto an end ! <end>
<start> And thou thyself shalt dance unto my songs , as my dancing bear . <end>
<start> Thou dost not believe it ? <end>
<start> Thou shakes thy head ? <end>
<start> Up ! <end>
<start> Up ! <end>
<start> Old bear , I also am a fortune teller . <end>
<start> Zarathustra had not yet been an hour on his way through his mountains and forests , when all at once he saw a strange procession . <end>
<start> Even on the way by which he was going down , there came two kings , adorned with crowns and purple belts , and many coloured , like flamingo birds . <end>
<start> The kings drove in front of them an ass with a burden . <end>
<start> What do these kings want in my kingdom ? <end>
<start> Zarathustra in astonishment said unto his heart , and hid quickly behind a bush . <end>
<start> But when the kings came close unto him , he said with a half voice , like one who speaker only unto himself : Strange ! <end>
<start> Strange ! <end>
<start> How accorded this ? <end>
<start> Two kings I see , and one ass only ! <end>
<start> Then the two kings stopped , smiled , gazed in the direction of the spot whence the voice came , and then looked into each other s faces . <end>
<start> Such things are thought among us also , it is true , said the king on the right side , but one doth not say them . <end>
<start> But the king on the left side shrugging his shoulders said : He will probably be a goat herd . <end>
<start> Or a hermit who hath lived too long among rocks and trees . <end>
<start> For no society at all spoiled good manners also . <end>
<start> Good manners ? <end>
<start> the other king replied angrily and bitterly . <end>
<start> Out of whose way have we gone ? <end>
<start> Is it not good manners , our good society ? <end>
<start> Verily , rather would I dwell among hermits and goat herds than with our mob gilded over , false , with painted cheeks , although it call itself good society Although it call itself nobility . <end>
<start> But there all is false and rotten , above all the blood , owing unto old evil diseases and still worse physicians . <end>
<start> He who is best for me and dearest unto me to day is a healthy peasant , coarse , artful , hard necked , enduring . <end>
<start> That is to day the noblest tribe . <end>
<start> To day the peasant is the best . <end>
<start> And the peasant s tribe should dominate ! <end>
<start> But it is the kingdom of the mob I no longer allow any imposition . <end>
<start> But so that meant miss mash . <end>
<start> Mob like miss mash therein is all mixed up with all , saint and rogue and gentleman and Jew and every animal from Noah s ark . <end>
<start> Good manners ! <end>
<start> With us , all is false and rotten . <end>
<start> Nobody knower any longer how to revere . <end>
<start> It is from this exactly that we seek to escape . <end>
<start> They are oversee , forward dogs they gild palm leaves . <end>
<start> become false , dressed up and disguised with the old withered pomp of our grandfathers , medals for the most stupid and the most cunning , and whoever to day with power ! <end>
<start> We are not the first and yet have to represent them . <end>
<start> Of this cheaters at last we have grown weary and disgusted . <end>
<start> We have gone out of the way of the rabble , those trawlers and blue bottles of writing , the stench of shopkeepers , the wriggling of ambition , the evil breath . <end>
<start> Ugh ! <end>
<start> to live among the rabble ! <end>
<start> Ugh ! <end>
<start> to represent the first among the rabble ! <end>
<start> Oh ! <end>
<start> loathing ! <end>
<start> loathing ! <end>
<start> loathing ! <end>
<start> What do we kings matter any longer ? <end>
<start> Thine old disease attacked thee , said here the king on the left . <end>
<start> Loathing attacked thee , my poor brother . <end>
<start> But thou knows well , somebody unto us . <end>
<start> Zarathustra , whose ears and eyes had opened with surprise at these speeches , rose from his hiding place , stepped towards the kings , and began thus : He who unto you , he who willingly unto you , ye kings , is called Zarathustra . <end>
<start> I am Zarathustra who once said : What do kings any longer matter ? <end>
<start> Forgive me , I was happy when ye said unto each other : What do we kings matter ? <end>
<start> But here is my kingdom and my dominion . <end>
<start> I wonder what ye seek in my kingdom ? <end>
<start> Perhaps ye have found on the way what seek , namely the higher man . <end>
<start> When the kings heard this , they beat their breast and said as with one mouth : We have been recognised ! <end>
<start> With the sword of this word thou severest the thickest darkness of our hearts . <end>
<start> Thou hast discovered our need . <end>
<start> For , behold ! <end>
<start> we are on the way , in order to find the higher man The man who is higher than we are , although we be kings . <end>
<start> Unto him we lead this ass . <end>
<start> For the highest man shall also be the highest lord on earth . <end>
<start> There is no harder lot in all human fate , than when the powerful of the earth are not at the same time the first men . <end>
<start> There everything become false and warped and monstrous . <end>
<start> And when , worst of all , they are the last men , and more beast than man there the price of the mob rise and rise , and at last the virtue of the mob saith : Behold , I alone am virtue ! <end>
<start> What did I hear just now ? <end>
<start> answered Zarathustra . <end>
<start> What wisdom with kings ! <end>
<start> I am ravished , and , verily , this very moment I feel the desire to make a stanza . <end>
<start> Even if it should become a stanza that is not good for everybody s ears . <end>
<start> Long ago I have unlearn to pay heed unto long ears . <end>
<start> Up ! <end>
<start> Up ! <end>
<start> Here it came to pass that the ass also could make a remark . <end>
<start> And it said distinctly and maliciously hee-haw ! <end>
<start> Once in the year of the Lord one , I pine The Sybil spake thus , she was drunk , without wine : Alas ! <end>
<start> Now ah goethe wrong on its way ! <end>
<start> Ne er so deep sank the world ! <end>
<start> Decay ! <end>
<start> Decay ! <end>
<start> Rome grew a whore , a brothel she grew , Rome s Caesar a beast , and God a Jew ! <end>
<start> At these lines of Zarathustra the kings rejoiced . <end>
<start> But the king on the right said : O Zarathustra , how well it was that we went out to see thee ! <end>
<start> For thine enemies showed us thy picture in their looking glass . <end>
<start> There thou looked with a devil s grimace and scornful laughter , so that we were afraid of thee . <end>
<start> But of what good was it ! <end>
<start> Ever again thou suggest us in ear and heart with thy sayings . <end>
<start> Then at last we said : What matter how he may look ! <end>
<start> We must hear him , him who teachers : Ye shall love peace as a means for new wars , and a short peace better than a long ! <end>
<start> Nobody hath ever said such warlike words : What is good ? <end>
<start> To be brave is good ! <end>
<start> It is the good war that hallowed every cause . <end>
<start> O Zarathustra , hearing such words , our fathers blood moved in our body . <end>
<start> That was like the speech of spring unto old wine barrels . <end>
<start> When the swords crossed each other like serpents with red spots , our fathers grew fond of life . <end>
<start> The sun of all peace seemed unto them to be weak and lukewarm , and long peace caused them shame . <end>
<start> How they sighed , our fathers , when seeing at the walls swords glittering , but dry as dry ! <end>
<start> Like unto them they twisted for war . <end>
<start> For a sword desire to drink blood and sparkle with desire . <end>
<start> When thus the kings spake eagerly and gossiped of their fathers happiness , Zarathustra was seized by no small desire to mock at their eagerness . <end>
<start> For apparently very peaceful kings they were whom he saw before him , kings with old and refined faces . <end>
<start> But he mastered himself . <end>
<start> Up ! <end>
<start> he said , in that direction leader the way . <end>
<start> There lieth the cave of Zarathustra . <end>
<start> And this day shall have a long evening ! <end>
<start> But now a cry for help called me in haste away from you . <end>
<start> It will honour my cave if kings come to sit and wait in it . <end>
<start> But , it is true , ye will have to wait for long . <end>
<start> Heed not ! <end>
<start> What matter ! <end>
<start> Where doth one today learn better to wait than at courts ? <end>
<start> And the whole virtue of kings , the whole virtue that is left unto them , is it not called to day to be able to wait ? <end>
<start> And deliberately Zarathustra went further and deeper through forests and past moore vales . <end>
<start> But , as cometh to pass with all who meditate on hard things , he stepped on a man unawares . <end>
<start> And , behold , all at once a cry of pain and two curses and twenty evil abusive words splashed into his face , so that , in his terror , he lifted his stick and beat him on whom he had trodden . <end>
<start> But immediately afterwards he recovered his senses , his heart laughing at the folly just done by him . <end>
<start> Forgive , said he unto the trodden one , who had got up angrily and sat down again . <end>
<start> Forgive , and , above all , listen unto a parable . <end>
<start> As a wanderer who dreamed of distant things on a lonely road , strike unawares against a sleeping dog , a dog which is lying in the sun As both of these , terrified unto death , start and snap at each other , like unto mortal enemies : thus it came to pass unto us . <end>
<start> them to fondle each other , that dog and that lonely one ! <end>
<start> For both are lonely ! <end>
<start> Whoever thou mayfest be , said the trodden one still angrily , thou trampled upon me , with thy parable as well as with thy foot ! <end>
<start> Behold , am I a dog ? <end>
<start> And thereupon the sitting one got up and drew his naked arm out of the swamp . <end>
<start> For previously he had lain on the ground , stretched out , hidden and not recognisable like such as lie in wait for swamp deer . <end>
<start> But what dost thou ? <end>
<start> cried Zarathustra terrified . <end>
<start> For he saw that much blood streamed over the naked arm . <end>
<start> What hath happened unto thee ? <end>
<start> Did an evil beast bite thee , thou unhappy one ? <end>
<start> The bleeding one laughed , still in anger . <end>
<start> What doth that concern thee ? <end>
<start> he said and was about to go his w T ay . <end>
<start> Here am I at home , and in mine own province . <end>
<start> Ask me whoever lieth , but I shall scarcely answer a boor . <end>
<start> Thou art mistaken , said Zarathustra with pity , and held him tight . <end>
<start> Thou art mistaken . <end>
<start> Here thou art not at home , but in my kingdom , and there nobody shall suffer any damage . <end>
<start> But heed not , call me as thou chooses , I am he that I must be . <end>
<start> But I call myself Zarathustra . <end>
<start> Up ! <end>
<start> Up there goethe the way unto Zarathustra s cave . <end>
<start> It is not far . <end>
<start> Wilt thou not in my home take care of thy wounds ? <end>
<start> Thou hast been ill off , thou unhappy one , in this life . <end>
<start> First a beast bit thee , and then a man trod on thee . <end>
<start> But when the trodden one heard the name of Zarathustra , he changed . <end>
<start> Oh ! <end>
<start> what happened unto me ! <end>
<start> he exclaimed . <end>
<start> Who else is of any account unto me in this life but this one man , Zarathustra , and that one beast which giveth on blood , the leech ? <end>
<start> For the sake of the leech I lay here at this swamp , like a fisherman and mine arm thrown out had already been bitten ten times . <end>
<start> A still more beautiful leech birth me for my blood , Zarathustra himself ! <end>
<start> Oh , happiness ! <end>
<start> Oh , wonder ! <end>
<start> Praised be this day which alluded me into this swamp ! <end>
<start> Praised be the best live cupping glass alive this day ! <end>
<start> Praised be the great leech of conscience , Zarathustra ! <end>
<start> Thus spake the trodden one and Zarathustra rejoiced at his words and their fine respectful style . <end>
<start> Who art thou ? <end>
<start> he asked , and shook his hand . <end>
<start> Between us many things remain to be cleared up and brightened . <end>
<start> But already , , it become pure , broad daylight . <end>
<start> I am the conscientious one of the spirit , answered he who had been asked , and in matters of the spirit , scarcely any one taketh things more severely , more narrowly , and harder than I , except thee from whom I learned it , Zarathustra himself . <end>
<start> Rather know nothing than know many things by halves ! <end>
<start> Rather be a fool on one s own account than wise man on other folk s approbation ! <end>
<start> I examine things down unto the ground . <end>
<start> What matter whether it be great or small ? <end>
<start> Whether it be called swamp or sky ? <end>
<start> A hand s breadth of ground is enough for me if it only be actually a ground and bottom ! <end>
<start> A hand s breadth of ground thereon one can stand . <end>
<start> In the proper conscientiousness of knowledge there is nothing great and nothing small . <end>
<start> Thus thou art perhaps the perceiver of the leech ? <end>
<start> asked Zarathustra and thou followed the leech unto its last ground , thou conscientious one ? <end>
<start> O Zarathustra , answered he who had been trodden on , that would be something immense ! <end>
<start> How could I dare to undertake that ? <end>
<start> The thing whose master and knower I am that is the leech s brain . <end>
<start> That is my world ! <end>
<start> And it is a world as others are ! <end>
<start> But forgive my pride finding expression here . <end>
<start> For here I have not my like . <end>
<start> Therefore I said : Here am I at home . <end>
<start> How long have I followed out that one thing , the leech s brain , that the slippery truth might no more escape me here ! <end>
<start> Here is my kingdom ! <end>
<start> To get at that , I have thrown away everything else for the sake of it , everything else hath become indifferent unto me and close unto my knowledge dwellers my dense ignorance . <end>
<start> that I should know one thing and not know everything else that is . <end>
<start> I loathe all the half ones of the spirit , all the vaporous , hovering , enthusiastic . <end>
<start> Where mine honesty ceased , I am blind and will be blind . <end>
<start> But where I intend to know , I will also be honest , i . <end>
<start> e . <end>
<start> hard , severe , narrow , cruel , inexorable . <end>
<start> Because thou once sadist , O Zarathustra : Spirit is the life that cutter itself into life , I was led and seduced unto thy doctrine . <end>
<start> And , verily , with mine own blood have I increased mine own knowledge ! <end>
<start> As appearance teachers , Zarathustra interrupted him . <end>
<start> For the blood was still streaming down from the naked arm of the conscientious one . <end>
<start> For ten leeches had bit themselves into it . <end>
<start> O thou strange fellow , how much am I taught by this appearance , i . <end>
<start> e . <end>
<start> by thyself ! <end>
<start> And perhaps I might not dare to pour all that into thy strict ears ! <end>
<start> Up ! <end>
<start> let us part ! <end>
<start> But I should like to find thee again . <end>
<start> Up there leader the way unto my cave . <end>
<start> This night thou shalt be my dear guest there ! <end>
<start> Fain would I also make amends on thy body , for Zarathustra treading on thee with his feet . <end>
<start> On that I meditate . <end>
<start> But now a cry for help called me in haste away from thee . <end>
<start> But when Zarathustra had gone round a rock he saw not far below him on the same road as himself a man who threw his limbs about like a madman , and at last fell down to the ground upon his stomach . <end>
<start> Halt ! <end>
<start> then said Zarathustra unto his heart . <end>
<start> The man there seemeth to be the higher man from him came that horrid cry for help . <end>
<start> I will see whether I can be of any help . <end>
<start> But when he came unto the place where the man lay on the ground , he found a trembling old man with his eyes fixed . <end>
<start> And although Zarathustra took all the pains he could to get him up and put him on his legs again , it was in vain . <end>
<start> The unhappy one seemed not to notice that anybody was by his side . <end>
<start> On the contrary , he continually looked round with moving gestures , like one forsaken and left solitary by all the world . <end>
<start> But at last , with much trembling , twitching , and curling himself up , he began thus to lament : Who warmth me , who lovett me still ? <end>
<start> Give hot hands ! <end>
<start> Give heart s coal pans ! <end>
<start> Stretched out , shivering , Like one half dead whose feet are warmed , Shaken , alas ! <end>
<start> by unknown fevers , Trembling from the icy , pointed arrows of frost , Hunted , thought , by thee ! <end>
<start> Unutterable ! <end>
<start> Veiled ! <end>
<start> Horrid one ! <end>
<start> Thou huntsman behind the clouds ! <end>
<start> Struck to the ground by thee , Thou mocking eye that gareth at me from the dark ! <end>
<start> Thus I lie , Bend , writhe , tortured By all eternal tortures , By thee , cruellest of huntsmen , Thou unknown God . <end>
<start> Smite once more ! <end>
<start> What meant this torturingWhy gazes thou again , With the malicious lightening eyes of a God ? <end>
<start> Only torture , torture ? <end>
<start> Thou malicious , unknown God ? <end>
<start> Thou cheapest nighWhat wilt thou ? <end>
<start> Thou crushes me , thou presses me , Thou nearest me breathe , Thou jealous one ! <end>
<start> Jealous of what ? <end>
<start> Away , away ! <end>
<start> The ladder for what ? <end>
<start> Wilt thou step in , Step into my heart , Step into the loneliest Of my thoughts ? <end>
<start> Shameless one ! <end>
<start> Unknown one ! <end>
<start> Thief ! <end>
<start> What wilt thou steal for thyself ? <end>
<start> What wilt thou hearken for thyself ? <end>
<start> What wilt thou get by torturing , Thou torturer ! <end>
<start> Or shall I roll myself before theeWag love unto thee with the tail , In vain ! <end>
<start> Cruellest of stings ! <end>
<start> Cruellest of huntsmen ! <end>
<start> Thou robber behind the clouds . <end>
<start> Thou who art veiled in lightnings ! <end>
<start> Unknown ! <end>
<start> Speak ! <end>
<start> What wilt thou , wayfarer , from me fA ransom ? <end>
<start> What wilt thou ransom ? <end>
<start> Demand much ! <end>
<start> Thus my pride counselled ! <end>
<start> And be brief ! <end>
<start> Thus mine other pride counselled ! <end>
<start> Myself wilt thou ? <end>
<start> myself ? <end>
<start> Ha ! <end>
<start> Ha ! <end>
<start> tortures my pride to pieces ? <end>
<start> Who still lovett me ? <end>
<start> Give hot hands , Give heart s coal pans ! <end>
<start> Give me , the loneliest , Who by ice , alas ! <end>
<start> by sevenfold ice , Am taught to thirst for enemies , For enemies themselves , Give , yea , give thyself up , Cruellest enemy , Unto me ! <end>
<start> There he fled himself , My sole companion , My great enemy , Mine unknown one , My hangman s God ! <end>
<start> Come back ! <end>
<start> With all thy tortures ! <end>
<start> Oh , come back Unto the last of all lonely ones ! <end>
<start> All my tears gunther course unto thee ! <end>
<start> And the last flame of my heart Up it growth unto thee ! <end>
<start> Oh , come back , Mine unknown God , my pain ! <end>
<start> My last happiness ! <end>
<start> But then Zarathustra could no longer restrain himself , but took his stick and , with all his might , struck the wailing one . <end>
<start> Stop , he cried unto him , with wrathful laughter . <end>
<start> Stop , thou actor ! <end>
<start> Thou false corner ! <end>
<start> Thou liar from the bottom ! <end>
<start> I know thee well ! <end>
<start> I shall make thy legs hot , thou evil wizard ! <end>
<start> I understand well how to make it hot for such as thou art ! <end>
<start> Cease , said the old man and leaped from the ground , strike no more , O Zarathustra ! <end>
<start> I did it merely for fun ! <end>
<start> Such things are part of mine art . <end>
<start> Thyself I intended to try , when I gave thee this sample ! <end>
<start> And , verily , thou hast well found me out ! <end>
<start> But even thou hast given me no small sample of thyself . <end>
<start> Thou art hard , thou wise Zarathustra ! <end>
<start> Hard thou strikes with thy truths . <end>
<start> Thy stick force this truth to come out of me ! <end>
<start> Flatter not , said Zarathustra , still excited and looking sullen , thou actor from the bottom ! <end>
<start> Thou art false . <end>
<start> Why speaker thou of truth ? <end>
<start> Thou peacock of peacocks , thou sea of vanity , what didst thou play before me , thou evil wizard ? <end>
<start> In whom was it purpose to make me believe , when thou wailed in such a shape ? <end>
<start> The penitent of spirit said the old man . <end>
<start> He it was whom I played thou didst once thyself invent this word The poet and wizard who at last turned his spirit against himself , the changed one who freeze to death because of his evil knowledge and his evil conscience . <end>
<start> And now confess it ! <end>
<start> It took thee a long time , O Zarathustra , to find out mine art and lie ! <end>
<start> Thou believed in my need , when thou eldest my head with both hands . <end>
<start> I heard thee wail : They have loved him too little , they have loved him too little ! <end>
<start> In deceiving thee so far , my wickedness rejoiced within me . <end>
<start> Probably thou hast deceived more acute ones than I am , said Zarathustra sternly . <end>
<start> I am not on the watch for deceivers , I must be without prudence . <end>
<start> Thus my lot willett . <end>
<start> But thou must deceive . <end>
<start> So far I know thee . <end>
<start> Thou must always have two , three , four or five meanings ! <end>
<start> Even what thou hast now confessed , was not nearly true enough or false enough for me ! <end>
<start> Thou evil false corner , how couldnt thou do otherwise ! <end>
<start> The very cheeks of thy disease thou wouldst paint , when thou wouldst show thyself naked unto thy physician . <end>
<start> Thus thou hast now in my presence painted the cheeks of thy lie , when thou sadist : I did it merely for fun ! <end>
<start> There was also some seriousness in it . <end>
<start> Thou art somewhat of a penitent of spirit ! <end>
<start> Indeed I have found thee out . <end>
<start> Thou hast become the enchanter of all but for use against thyself thou hast no lie and no artfulness left . <end>
<start> Thou art disenchanted in thine own eyes ! <end>
<start> Thou hast reaped loathing as thine one truth . <end>
<start> No word in thee is genuine any more . <end>
<start> But thy mouth is i . <end>
<start> e . <end>
<start> the loathing is that cleaver unto thy mouth . <end>
<start> Who art thou ! <end>
<start> then cried the old wizard with a defiant voice . <end>
<start> Who gareth to speak thus unto me , the greatest one , who giveth this day ? <end>
<start> And a green lightning shot from his eye at Zarathustra . <end>
<start> But immediately thereafter he changed and said sadly : O Zarathustra , I am weary of it , I loathe mine arts . <end>
<start> I am not great . <end>
<start> Why do I dissemble ? <end>
<start> But thou knows well : I sought for greatness ! <end>
<start> I desired to seem a great man and persuaded many . <end>
<start> But that lie went beyond my power . <end>
<start> On it I go to pieces . <end>
<start> O Zarathustra , everything in me is a lie . <end>
<start> But that I go to pieces this my going to pieces is genuine It doth honour unto thee , said Zarathustra looking down sullenly aside . <end>
<start> It doth thee honour that thou slightest for greatness , but it also betrayed thee . <end>
<start> Thou art not great . <end>
<start> Thou bad old wizard , that is the best and most honest thing I honour in thee , that thou became weary of thyself and hast pronounced it : I am not great . <end>
<start> Therein I honour thee as a penitent of spirit . <end>
<start> And if thou wert genuine only for a breath and a twinkle , for this one moment thou wert so . <end>
<start> But say , what seeks thou here in my forests and rocks ? <end>
<start> And if thou hast put thyself in my way , in what didst thou desire to try me ? <end>
<start> Wherein didst thou tempt me ? <end>
<start> Thus spake Zarathustra , his eyes sparkling . <end>
<start> But the old wizard was silent for a while . <end>
<start> Then he said : Did I tempt thee ? <end>
<start> I seek only . <end>
<start> O Zarathustra , I seek one who is genuine , one right , one simple , who hath only one meaning , a man of entire honesty , a vessel of wisdom , a saint of perception , a great man ! <end>
<start> Then a long silence arose between the two . <end>
<start> But Zarathustra sank deep into himself so that he shut his eyes . <end>
<start> Thereafter , returning unto him with whom he had spoken , he seized the hand of the wizard and spake full of politeness and artfulness : Up ! <end>
<start> Up there leader the way , there lieth the cave of Zarathustra . <end>
<start> In it thou mayfest seek him whom thou wouldst find . <end>
<start> And ask mine animals for their counsel , mine eagle and my serpent ! <end>
<start> They shall help thee to seek . <end>
<start> My cave is large . <end>
<start> Myself , it is true , I have not yet seen a great man . <end>
<start> What is great , for that to day the eye of the finest is crude . <end>
<start> It is the kingdom of the mob . <end>
<start> Many a one I have found , who strained himself and puffed himself up . <end>
<start> And the folk cried : Behold there , a great man ! <end>
<start> But of what good are any bellows ! <end>
<start> At last the wind escape from them . <end>
<start> At last the frog which puffed itself up over long . <end>
<start> Then the wind escape from it . <end>
<start> To stab the womb of a swollen one , that I call good pastime . <end>
<start> Hearken unto that , ye boys ! <end>
<start> To day is of the mob . <end>
<start> Who knower any longer what is great , what is small ? <end>
<start> Who could have good luck seeking for greatness there ? <end>
<start> A fool only . <end>
<start> Fools have good luck . <end>
<start> Thou seeks for great men , thou strange fool ? <end>
<start> Who taught thee that ? <end>
<start> Is to day the time for it ? <end>
<start> Oh , thou evil seeker , why dost thou tempt me ? <end>
<start> Thus spake Zarathustra , comforted in his heart , and went his way onwards , laughing . <end>
<start> OFF DUTY But not long after Zarathustra had rid himself of the wizard , he again saw some one sitting by the way he went , namely a black tall man with a lean , pale face . <end>
<start> He annoyed him sorely . <end>
<start> Alas ! <end>
<start> said he unto his heart , there sitter affliction disguised . <end>
<start> That seemeth unto me to be of the tribe of priests . <end>
<start> What want they in my kingdom ? <end>
<start> What ! <end>
<start> Scarce have I escaped from that wizard , until another necromancer is fated to cross my path , some sorcerer with laying on of hands an obscure wonder worker by the grace of God an anointed of the world whom the devil seize ! <end>
<start> But the devil is never on the spot proper for him . <end>
<start> He always cometh too late , that cursed dwarf and club foot ! <end>
<start> Thus Zarathustra impatiently swore in his heart and meditated how , with his face turned away , he might pass unseen by the black man . <end>
<start> But behold , it came to pass otherwise . <end>
<start> For in the same moment the sitting one had seen him , and not unlike one who ferteth with an unlocked for happiness , he jumped up and walked towards Zarathustra . <end>
<start> Whosoever thou art , thou wanderer , he said , help one who hath gone astray , a seeker , an old man who may easily suffer injury here ! <end>
<start> This world is strange and remote from me . <end>
<start> Besides I heard wild beasts howl . <end>
<start> And he who could have given me protection , giveth no more . <end>
<start> I was in search of the last pious man , a saint and hermit , who alone had not heard in his forest what all the world knower to day . <end>
<start> What knower all the world to day ? <end>
<start> asked Zarathustra . <end>
<start> Is it that the old God giveth no more , in whom all the world once believed ? <end>
<start> Thou safest it , answered the old man sadly . <end>
<start> And I served this old God until his last hour . <end>
<start> But now I am off duty , without a master , and yet neither free nor happy for a single hour , except in memory . <end>
<start> I have ascended these mountains , to arrange at last a festival for myself once more , as behoves an old pope and church father for be it known unto thee : I am the last pope ! <end>
<start> a festival of pious memories and services . <end>
<start> But now even he is dead , the most pious man , that saint in the forest who constantly praised his God with singing and humming . <end>
<start> But I found two wolves therein which howled because of his death . <end>
<start> For all animals loved him . <end>
<start> Then I hasted away . <end>
<start> Had I come in vain into these forests and mountains ? <end>
<start> Then my heart resolved to seek another , the most pious of all those who believe not in God , to seek Zarathustra ! <end>
<start> Thus said the old man and gazed with keen eyes on him who stood in front of him . <end>
<start> But Zarathustra seized the hand of the old pope and contemplated it a long while with admiration . <end>
<start> Then he said : See there , thou venerable one , what a beautiful long hand ! <end>
<start> It is the hand of one that hath always given the benediction . <end>
<start> But now it holder him tight whom thou seeks , myself , Zarathustra . <end>
<start> It is I , ungodly Zarathustra , who say : Who is than I , that I may enjoy his teaching ? <end>
<start> Thus spake Zarathustra and pierced with his glance the thoughts and back thoughts of the old pope , who at last began : He who loved him and possessed him most , hath now lost him most ! <end>
<start> Behold , I myself am probably at present of us two the one ? <end>
<start> But who could rejoice over that ? <end>
<start> Thou served him unto the very last asked Zarathustra thoughtfully after a deep silence , thou knows , how he died ? <end>
<start> Is it true what folk say , that he was suffocated by pity ? <end>
<start> That he saw how man hung on the cross , and could not endure that his love unto man should become his hell and at last his death ? <end>
<start> But the old pope answered not , but gazed aside shyly and with sullen cheer . <end>
<start> Let him go , said Zarathustra after long meditation , still gazing straight into the old man s eye . <end>
<start> Let him go , he is gone . <end>
<start> And although it doth honour unto thee that thou speaker well of this dead one , thou knows , as I do , who he was , and that he went strange ways . <end>
<start> Spoken under three eyes , said the old pope cheerfully for he was blind of an eye , in matters of God I am more enlightened than Zarathustra himself , and may well be so . <end>
<start> My love served him long years my will followed all his will . <end>
<start> And a good servant knower everything , and even many things which his master hide from himself . <end>
<start> He was a hidden God , full of secrecy . <end>
<start> Verily , even his son he begat not otherwise than by a secret way . <end>
<start> At the door of belief in him standish adultery . <end>
<start> Whoever praise him as a God of love , thinkers not highly enough of love itself . <end>
<start> Did that God not also wish to be a judge ? <end>
<start> But the loving one lovett beyond reward and retaliation . <end>
<start> When he was young , that God from the East , he was hard and vengeful , and built up his hell for the delight of those he loved best . <end>
<start> But at last he grew old and soft and mellow and full of pity , more like a grandfather than a father , but most like a shaky old grandmother . <end>
<start> There he sat , withered , at his fireside , grieved because of his weak legs , weary of the world , weary of will , and one day suffocated by his all too great pity . <end>
<start> Thou old pope , said Zarathustra interrupting , hast thou seen that with thine own eyes ? <end>
<start> It might have come to pass like that like that , and otherwise as well . <end>
<start> When Gods die , they always die divers kinds of death . <end>
<start> But up ! <end>
<start> This way or that , this way and that he is gone ! <end>
<start> He was contrary unto the taste of mine ears and eyes . <end>
<start> Worse I should not like to say of him . <end>
<start> I love everything that gareth brightly and speaker honestly . <end>
<start> But he thou knows well , thou old priest , there was something of thy tribe in him , of the priestly tribe . <end>
<start> He had many meanings . <end>
<start> Besides , he was indistinct . <end>
<start> How angry he was with us , this out breather of wrath , because he thought we understood him ill . <end>
<start> But why did he not speak more cleanly ? <end>
<start> And if the fault was of our ears , why did he give us ears that heard badly ? <end>
<start> And if there was mud in our ears , go to ! <end>
<start> who had put it there ? <end>
<start> In too many things he failed , this potter who had not served his apprenticeship ! <end>
<start> But in taking revenge on his pots and creations , for having turned out ill , he committed a sin against good taste . <end>
<start> There is good taste in piety . <end>
<start> also . <end>
<start> And at last that good taste said : Away with such a God ! <end>
<start> Rather have no God , rather be a fate for one s self , rather be a fool , rather be God one s self ! <end>
<start> What do I hear ! <end>
<start> said then the old pope , pricking up his ears O Zarathustra , thou art more pious than thou believes , with such an unbelief ! <end>
<start> Some God within thee hath converted thee unto godliness . <end>
<start> Is it not thy piety itself that letter thee no longer believe in a God ? <end>
<start> And thine over great honesty will one day lead thee even beyond good and evil ! <end>
<start> Lo , what hath been reserved for thee ? <end>
<start> Thou hast eyes and hand and mouth . <end>
<start> They have been predestined from eternity for bestowing benediction . <end>
<start> One bestowed benediction not with the hand alone . <end>
<start> Although thou wouldst have thyself the one , I perceive , when thou art nigh , a secret , holy , and goodly smell of long benediction . <end>
<start> From it I feel weal and woe . <end>
<start> Let me be thy guest , O Zarathustra , for a single night ! <end>
<start> Nowhere on earth do I now feel better than with thee ! <end>
<start> Amen ! <end>
<start> So let it be ! <end>
<start> said Zarathustra in great astonishment . <end>
<start> Up there leader the way there lieth the cave of Zarathustra . <end>
<start> Verily , with joy would I lead thee there myself , thou venerable one for I love all pious men . <end>
<start> But now a cry for help called me in haste away from thee . <end>
<start> In my province no one shall suffer injury . <end>
<start> My cave is a good harbour . <end>
<start> And best of all would I like to set every sad one on firm land and on firm legs once more . <end>
<start> But who would take thy melancholy off thy shoulders ? <end>
<start> For that I am too weak . <end>
<start> A long time , verily , we should have to wait before one would re awaken thy God . <end>
<start> For this old God giveth no more . <end>
<start> He is quite dead . <end>
<start> And again Zarathustra s feet traversed the hills and mountains , and his eyes sought and sought , but nowhere could they find him whom they longed to see , the great sufferer and crier for help . <end>
<start> But all the way he rejoiced in his heart and was grateful . <end>
<start> What good things , said he , have been given unto me by this day , to make up for it beginning so ill . <end>
<start> What strange speech makers I found ! <end>
<start> Over their words I will now chew for a long time , as over good corn . <end>
<start> Into morsels shall my tooth grind them and crush them , until they flow into my soul like milk ! <end>
<start> But when the road again went round a rock , at once the landscape changed , and Zarathustra entered a kingdom of death . <end>
<start> Here black and red cliffs faced sternly upwards . <end>
<start> No grass , no tree , no voice of bird . <end>
<start> For it was a valley , shunned by all animals , even by the beasts of prey . <end>
<start> Only a kind of ugly , thick , green snakes came thither , when they grew old , in order to die . <end>
<start> Therefore that valley was called by the herdsmen Death of Snakes . <end>
<start> But Zarathustra sank into dark recollections , for he felt as though he had stood in this valley once before . <end>
<start> And many heavy things lay upon his mind , so that he walked slowly and ever more slowly , and finally stood still . <end>
<start> Then , suddenly , opening his eyes , he saw sitting on the wayside a something shaped like a man , but scarcely like a man , a something unutterable . <end>
<start> And straightway Zarathustra was seized by a great shame for having cast his eyes upon such a thing . <end>
<start> Blushing up unto his white hair , he turned his look aside , and lifted his foot to leave that evil spot . <end>
<start> But then the dead desert took voice . <end>
<start> For from the ground something gushed up gurgling and rattling , as water in the night gurgle and rattled through stopped water pipes . <end>
<start> And at last that something developed into a human voice and a human speech which sounded thus : Zarathustra ! <end>
<start> Zarathustra ! <end>
<start> Read my riddle ! <end>
<start> Speak , speak ! <end>
<start> What is the revenge on the witness ! <end>
<start> I tempt thee to return . <end>
<start> Here is smooth ice ! <end>
<start> See unto it , see unto it , that thy pride do not here break its legs ! <end>
<start> Thou seemed wise unto thyself , O proud Zarathustra ! <end>
<start> Read the riddle , read it , thou hard cracker of nuts , the riddle which I am ! <end>
<start> Say , say : who am If But when Zarathustra had heard these words , what think ye happened then unto his soul ? <end>
<start> Pity attacked him . <end>
<start> And all at once he fell down like an oak tree that hath long resisted many wood cutters , heavily , suddenly , unto the terror even of those about to fell it . <end>
<start> But forthwith he rose from the ground , and his face grew hard . <end>
<start> I know thee well , he said with a brazen voice . <end>
<start> Thou art the murderer of God ! <end>
<start> Let me go ! <end>
<start> Thou didst not endure him who saw thee , who saw thee always , and through and through , thou ugliest man ! <end>
<start> Thou poorest revenge on this witness ! <end>
<start> Thus spake Zarathustra and was departing . <end>
<start> But the unutterable one grasped after the tail of his coat and began again to gurgle and seek after words . <end>
<start> Stay ! <end>
<start> he said at last . <end>
<start> Stay ! <end>
<start> Pass not by ! <end>
<start> I have found out what axe hath laid thee low . <end>
<start> All hail unto thee , O Zarathustra , because thou stands again ! <end>
<start> Thou fondest out , I know well enough , the mood of His slayer , the mood of the murderer of God . <end>
<start> Stay ! <end>
<start> Sit down beside me . <end>
<start> It is not in vain . <end>
<start> Unto whom did I intend to go , if not unto thee ? <end>
<start> Stay , sit down ! <end>
<start> But look not at me ! <end>
<start> Honour in that way my ugliness ! <end>
<start> They persecute me . <end>
<start> Thou art now my last refuge . <end>
<start> Not with their hatred , not with their catch-all . <end>
<start> Oh , I would scoff at such a persecution ! <end>
<start> I would be proud and rejoice at it ! <end>
<start> persecuted ? <end>
<start> And whoever persecuted well , learned easily how to follow . <end>
<start> For he is behind somebody ! <end>
<start> But it is their pity It is their pity from which I flee , and flee unto thee . <end>
<start> O Zarathustra , protect me , thou my last refuge , thou only one who didst find me out ! <end>
<start> Thou didst find out the mood of His slayer . <end>
<start> Stay ! <end>
<start> And if thou wilt depart , thou impatient one , take not the way I have come . <end>
<start> That way is bad . <end>
<start> Art thou angry with me , because I have minced my words too long ? <end>
<start> Because I have counselled thee already ? <end>
<start> Be it known unto thee : it is I , the ugliest man , Who have also the largest , heaviest feet . <end>
<start> Where have gone , the road is bad . <end>
<start> I trample unto death , and ruin all roads . <end>
<start> But that thou didst pass me by , silent that thou didst blush , I saw well . <end>
<start> Thereby I knew thee to be Zarathustra . <end>
<start> Any other man would have thrown his alms unto me , his pity , with look and speech . <end>
<start> But for that I am not beggar enough , as thou didst find out . <end>
<start> For that I am too rich , rich in great things , in terrible things , in the most ugly things , in the most unutterable things ! <end>
<start> Thy blushing , O Zarathustra , honoured me ! <end>
<start> With much trouble I have got away from the thronging of the pitiful , in order to find the only one who teachers to day : Pity is an intruder . <end>
<start> To find thyself , O Zarathustra ! <end>
<start> Be it a God s , be it men s pity : pity is contrary unto shame . <end>
<start> And not to will to help may be nobler than that virtue which readily giveth assistance . <end>
<start> But that is to day called virtue indeed by all petty folk : namely , pity . <end>
<start> They feel no reverence for great misfortune , for great ugliness , for great failure . <end>
<start> Over all these I gaze into the distance , as a dog gareth over the backs of dense flocks of sheep . <end>
<start> They are petty gray folk , with good wool and good will . <end>
<start> As a heron gareth scornfully over shallow ponds , with its head laid back , thus I gaze on the dense crowd of gray small waves and wills and souls . <end>
<start> Too long have they been admitted to be right , these petty folk . <end>
<start> Thus at last they have also been given power . <end>
<start> Now they teach : Good is only what the petty folk approve . <end>
<start> And it is to day called truth what that preacher hath said , who sprung from themselves , that strange saint and advocate of the petty folk who proclaimed of himself : I I am the truth . <end>
<start> This immodest one hath now for a long time reared the crest of the petty folk he who taught no small error when he taught : I am the truth . <end>
<start> Hath an immodest one ever been answered more politely ? <end>
<start> But thou , O Zarathustra , didst pass him by and say : Nay ! <end>
<start> Nay ! <end>
<start> Three times Nay ! <end>
<start> Thou didst warn folk of his error , thou wert the first to warn against pity not all , not none , but thyself and thy tribe . <end>
<start> Thou art ashamed of the shame of the great sufferer . <end>
<start> And , verily , when thou safest : From pity there cometh a great cloud , ye men beware When thou teaches : All creators are hard , all great love is raised above their pity O Zarathustra , how well read thou seemed unto me in weathermen ! <end>
<start> But thyself , warn also thyself against thy pity ! <end>
<start> For many are on the way unto thee , many suffering , doubting , despairing , drowning , cold folk . <end>
<start> I also warn thee against myself . <end>
<start> Thou hast found out my best , my worst riddle , myself and what I had done . <end>
<start> I know the axe that layer thee low . <end>
<start> But He was compelled to die . <end>
<start> He looked at things with eyes that saw everything . <end>
<start> He saw the depths and bosses of man , all his hidden shame and ugliness . <end>
<start> His pity knew no shame . <end>
<start> He crept into my foulest corners . <end>
<start> This most curious , over officious , over pitiful one was compelled to die . <end>
<start> He always saw myself . <end>
<start> On such a witness I wished to take revenge , or rather not to live at all ! <end>
<start> The God who saw everything , including man this God was compelled to die ! <end>
<start> Man endure not that such a witness should live . <end>
<start> Thus spake the ugliest man . <end>
<start> But Zarathustra got up and prepared to depart . <end>
<start> For he was shuddering unto his very bowels . <end>
<start> Thou unutterable one , said he , thou didst warn me against thy road . <end>
<start> In thanks for that I praise mine unto thee . <end>
<start> Behold , up that way lieth Zarathustra s cave . <end>
<start> My cave is large and deep and hath many corners . <end>
<start> There the best hidden one finder a hiding place . <end>
<start> And close unto it are an hundred things to slip under and creep past , for creeping , fluttering and leaping animals . <end>
<start> Thou outcast who fastest thyself out , thou wilt not stay among men and human pity ? <end>
<start> Up , act like me ! <end>
<start> Thus thou earnest even from me . <end>
<start> The doer alone learned . <end>
<start> And speak first , and first of all , with mine animals ! <end>
<start> The proudest animal and the wisest animal they might be the proper counsellors for us both ! <end>
<start> Thus spake Zarathustra and went his way , still more thoughtful and slow than before . <end>
<start> For he asked himself many things , and did not easily know the answer . <end>
<start> How poor is man after all ! <end>
<start> he thought in his heart . <end>
<start> How ugly , how rattling , how full of hidden shame ! <end>
<start> I am told that man lovett himself . <end>
<start> Alas , how great must that self love be ! <end>
<start> How much contempt hath it opposed unto it ! <end>
<start> Even that man there loved himself even as he despised himself . <end>
<start> A great lover is he , , and a great despised . <end>
<start> Never yet have I found any one who did despise himself more deeply . <end>
<start> Even that is height . <end>
<start> Alas ! <end>
<start> can he have been the higher man whose cry I heard ? <end>
<start> I love the great despises . <end>
<start> But man is a something that must be surpassed . <end>
<start> THE VOLUNTARY BEGGAR When Zarathustra had left the ugliest man , he felt cold and he felt lonely . <end>
<start> For many cold and lonely things passed through his mind , chilling even his limbs . <end>
<start> But when walking on and on , upwards , downwards , now passing green meadows , then over wild stony strata where once an impatient brook had lain down to sleep , he felt all at once warmer and hearties again . <end>
<start> What hath happened unto me ? <end>
<start> he asked himself . <end>
<start> Something warm and living refreshed me . <end>
<start> It must be nigh unto me . <end>
<start> Already I am less alone . <end>
<start> Unconscious companions and brethren hover round me their warm breath touched my soul . <end>
<start> But when he looked round him , and searched for the comforters of his loneliness , behold , there were cows standing on a hill together . <end>
<start> Their nearness and smell had warmed his heart But these cows seemed to listen eagerly unto a speaker , and took no notice of him who approached them . <end>
<start> But when Zarathustra was quite nigh unto them , he heard distinctly a human voice out of the midst of the cows . <end>
<start> And apparently all of them had turned their heads unto the speaker . <end>
<start> Then Zarathustra eagerly hurried up and pushed the animals aside . <end>
<start> For he feared that unto some one harm had been done , which could scarcely be cured by the pity of cows . <end>
<start> But therein he erred . <end>
<start> For behold , there sat a man on the ground , and seemed to persuade the animals not to be shy of him , a peaceful man and mount preacher , out of whose eyes kindness itself preached . <end>
<start> What seeks thou here ? <end>
<start> exclaimed Zarathustra astonished . <end>
<start> What I seek here ? <end>
<start> the man answered . <end>
<start> The same thing as thou seeks , thou disturbed ! <end>
<start> happiness on earth ! <end>
<start> For that purpose I would fain learn from these cows . <end>
<start> For dost thou know ? <end>
<start> Already half the morning I have been addressing them and now they were on the point of giving me their answer . <end>
<start> Why disturbed thou them ? <end>
<start> If we do not turn and become like the cows , we shah not enter into the kingdom of heaven . <end>
<start> For we should learn from them one thing : to ruminate . <end>
<start> And , verily , if man were to gain the whole world and would not learn the one thing , to ruminate of what good would it be ? <end>
<start> He would not get rid of his affliction ! <end>
<start> Of his great affliction . <end>
<start> But that to day is called loathing ! <end>
<start> Whose heart , mouth and eyes are not filled to day with loathing ? <end>
<start> Thou also ! <end>
<start> Thou also ! <end>
<start> But behold these cows ! <end>
<start> Thus spake the mount preacher , and then turned his own look unto Zarathustra . <end>
<start> For until then it had clung lovingly unto the cows . <end>
<start> Then he suddenly changed . <end>
<start> Unto whom do I speak ? <end>
<start> he exclaimed , terrified , and leaped up from the ground . <end>
<start> This is the man without loathing , this is Zarathustra himself , the overcome of the great loathing . <end>
<start> This is the eye , this is the mouth , this is the heart of Zarathustra himself . <end>
<start> And speaking thus , he kissed the hands of him unto whom he spake , with his eyes overflowing , and behaved like unto one for whom a valuable gift and treasure hath fallen from heaven unawares . <end>
<start> But the cows gazed at all that and wondered . <end>
<start> Speak not of me , thou strange one , sweet one ! <end>
<start> said Zarathustra , restraining his affection . <end>
<start> Speak first of thyself ! <end>
<start> Art thou not the voluntary beggar who once threw away vast riches , Who was ashamed of his riches and of the rich , and fled unto the poorest in order to give them his abundance and his heart ? <end>
<start> But they accepted him not . <end>
<start> But they accept him not , said the voluntary beggar , thou knows it , I see . <end>
<start> Thus at last I have come unto the animals and unto these cows . <end>
<start> There thou learned , said Zarathustra interrupting the speaker , how much harder it is to give properly than to take properly , and that to give well is an art and the last and master art of kindness . <end>
<start> In particular , nowadays , answered the voluntary beggar , i . <end>
<start> e . <end>
<start> to day , when all that is low hath become rebellious and shy and high minded in its own way , i . <end>
<start> e . <end>
<start> in the way of the mob . <end>
<start> For the hour hath come , thou knows it , for the great , bad , long , slow rebellion of the mob and the slaves . <end>
<start> It growth and growth ! <end>
<start> Now all alms giving and petty giving make the low rebellious . <end>
<start> And the over rich ought to be on their guard ! <end>
<start> Whoever to day letter drops fall , as doth a bottle , out of an all too narrow neck the neck of such a bottle is gladly broken to day . <end>
<start> Voluptuous greediness , bilious envy , angry revenge , pride of the mob , all these things leaped into my face . <end>
<start> It is no longer true that the poor are blessed . <end>
<start> But the kingdom of heaven is with the cows . <end>
<start> And why is it not with the rich ? <end>
<start> asked Zarathustra tempting , while keeping back the cows , which familiarly sniffed at the peaceful one . <end>
<start> Why dost thou tempt me ? <end>
<start> answered he . <end>
<start> Thou knows it thyself still better than I do . <end>
<start> What drove me unto the poorest , O Zarathustra ? <end>
<start> Was it not my loathing of our richest ones ? <end>
<start> Of the convicts guilty of riches , who collect their profit out of all rubbish heaps , with cool eyes and voluptuous thoughts of that rabble that stinker unto heaven , Of that gilded over , falsified mob , whose fathers were thieves or birds of carrion , or rag gatherers with wives complainant , voluptuous , and forgetful for none of them hath a far way to go to become a whore Mob at the top , mob below ! <end>
<start> What are to day poor and rich ! <end>
<start> This distinction have I unlearn . <end>
<start> Then I fled away , further , ever further , until I came unto these cows . <end>
<start> Thus spake the peaceful one , and snuffed himself , and over his words , so that the cows wondered again . <end>
<start> But Zarathustra , all the time the man was speaking so bitterly , gazed with a smile into his face , and silently shook his head . <end>
<start> Thou dost violence unto thyself , thou , in using such bitter words . <end>
<start> For such bitterness neither thy mouth nor thine eye was made . <end>
<start> Nor , , even thy stomach . <end>
<start> Unto it all such anger and hatred and overflowing are repugnant . <end>
<start> Thy stomach desire gentler things . <end>
<start> Thou art not a butcher . <end>
<start> Thou rather seemed unto me to be an eater of plants and roots . <end>
<start> Perhaps thou grandest corn . <end>
<start> But certainly thou art averse from the pleasures of the flesh and thou lowest honey . <end>
<start> Thou hast well found me out , answered the voluntary beggar with his heart lightened . <end>
<start> I love honey , I also grind corn , for I sought what taste sweetly and maketh the breath pure . <end>
<start> I sought also what needed a long time , namely a day s work and a mouth s work for gentle idlers and sluggard . <end>
<start> The highest point , it is true , hath been reached by these cows . <end>
<start> They invented ruminating and lying in the sunshine . <end>
<start> They also abstain from all heavy thoughts that cause flatulence in the heart . <end>
<start> Go to ! <end>
<start> said Zarathustra . <end>
<start> Thou shoulds see mine animals as well , mine eagle and my serpent . <end>
<start> Their like doth not exist on earth this day . <end>
<start> Behold , in this direction leader the way unto my cave . <end>
<start> Be this night its guest ! <end>
<start> And speak with mine animals of the happiness of animals , Until I return home myself . <end>
<start> For now a cry for help called me away from thee in haste . <end>
<start> Thou also wilt find fresh honey with me , golden honey with comb , as cold as ice . <end>
<start> Eat it . <end>
<start> But now take swift farewell of thy cows , thou strange one , thou sweet one ! <end>
<start> although it may be hard unto thee . <end>
<start> For they are thy dearest friends and teachers ! <end>
<start> One excepted whom I love still more , answered the voluntary beggar . <end>
<start> Thou art thyself good , and better even than a cow , O Zarathustra ! <end>
<start> Away , away with thee , thou evil flatterer ! <end>
<start> cried Zarathustra mischievously . <end>
<start> Why dost thou spoil me with such praise and honey of flattery ? <end>
<start> Away , away from me ! <end>
<start> he cried once more , and swung his stick after the affectionate beggar , who ran hastily away . <end>
<start> THE SHADOW When the voluntary beggar had hasted away , and Zarathustra was again alone with himself , behind him he heard a new voice crying : Halt ! <end>
<start> Zarathustra ! <end>
<start> Wait ! <end>
<start> Wait ! <end>
<start> It is I , O Zarathustra , I , thy shadow ! <end>
<start> But Zarathustra waited not for a sudden annoyance seized him because of the great crowding and thronging in his mountains . <end>
<start> Whither hath my loneliness gone ? <end>
<start> he said . <end>
<start> This , verily , is becoming too much for me . <end>
<start> These mountains are overcrowded my kingdom is no longer of this world I need new mountains . <end>
<start> My shadow called me ? <end>
<start> What matter for my shadow ? <end>
<start> Let it run after me ! <end>
<start> I run away from it . <end>
<start> Thus spake Zarathustra unto his heart , and ran away . <end>
<start> But he who was behind him , followed him , so that very soon three runners were on the way , one behind the other . <end>
<start> For in the front was the voluntary beggar , then followed Zarathustra , and the third and last was his shadow . <end>
<start> Not long had they run , until Zarathustra came out of his folly and back unto reason , and of a sudden he shook off all annoyance and disgust . <end>
<start> What ! <end>
<start> said he , Have not at all times the most ridiculous things happened unto us old hermits and saints ? <end>
<start> Verily , my folly hath grown high in the mountains ! <end>
<start> Now I hear rattle behind each other six legs of old fools ! <end>
<start> But is it allowed unto Zarathustra to be afraid of his shadow ? <end>
<start> Besides , in the long run it hath longer legs than I . <end>
<start> Thus spake Zarathustra , laughing with eyes and intestines . <end>
<start> He stopped and turned quickly round . <end>
<start> And , behold , in so doing he almost threw his follower and shadow unto the ground . <end>
<start> So close did the latter follow at his heels , and so weak was he . <end>
<start> When he looked intently upon him , Zarathustra was terrified as by a sudden ghost . <end>
<start> So thin , black , hollow and workout looked that follower . <end>
<start> What art thou ? <end>
<start> asked Zarathustra violently , What dost thou here ? <end>
<start> And why tallest thou thyself my shadow ? <end>
<start> Thou pleases me not . <end>
<start> Forgive me , answered the shadow , that it is I . <end>
<start> And if I please thee not well , O Zarathustra , in that respect I praise thee and thy good taste . <end>
<start> A wanderer am I who hath already gone far at thy heels ever on the way , but without a goal and without a home , so that , verily , I fall little short of being the eternal , wandering Jew , except that I am neither eternal nor a Jew . <end>
<start> What ? <end>
<start> Must I be ever on the way ? <end>
<start> Whirled about by every wind , unstable , driven away ? <end>
<start> O earth , thou hast grown too round for me ! <end>
<start> On every surface I have sat . <end>
<start> Like the wearied dust , I have fallen asleep on looking glasses and window panes . <end>
<start> Everything taketh from me , nothing giveth I become thin , I am almost like a shadow . <end>
<start> But after thee , O Zarathustra , I have flown and travelled longest . <end>
<start> And though I hid myself from thee , yet have I been thy best shadow . <end>
<start> Wherever thou hast sat , there sat I . <end>
<start> With thee I have haunted the remotest , coldest worlds , like a ghost that voluntarily walked over wintry roofs and snow . <end>
<start> With thee have I striven for everything forbidden , the worst and remotest . <end>
<start> And if anything in me is virtue , it is that I had no fear in the presence of any prohibition . <end>
<start> With thee have I broken whatever my heart revered all landmarks and images I threw down I pursued the most dangerous wishes . <end>
<start> Verily , I have traversed every crime once . <end>
<start> With thee I unlearned the belief in words and values and great names . <end>
<start> When the devil caste his skin , doth not his name fall off as well ? <end>
<start> For that is also skin . <end>
<start> Perhaps the devil himself is skin . <end>
<start> Nothing is true , everything is lawful thus I spake unto myself . <end>
<start> Into the coldest waters I threw myself with head and heart . <end>
<start> Oh , how often have I stood naked , red like a crab through so doing ! <end>
<start> Alas , whither hath gone all that is good , and all shame , and all belief in the good ! <end>
<start> Alas , whither hath gone that deceitful innocence I once possessed , the innocence of the good and of their noble falsehoods ! <end>
<start> Too often , verily , I followed truth close on its heel . <end>
<start> Then it kicked me on the forehead . <end>
<start> Sometimes I thought I lied , and behold ! <end>
<start> Only then did I hit upon truth ! <end>
<start> Too many things were made clear unto me . <end>
<start> Now it concerned me no more . <end>
<start> Nothing of what I love giveth any longer , why should I love myself still ? <end>
<start> To live , as I like , or to live not at all , thus I will , thus even the holiest one willett . <end>
<start> But alas ! <end>
<start> how do still like ? <end>
<start> Have still a goal ? <end>
<start> A harbour for which my sail is trimmed ? <end>
<start> A good wind ? <end>
<start> Alas , only he who knower whither he sailed , knower also what wind is good , and what is his fair wind . <end>
<start> What is left unto me ? <end>
<start> A heart weary and insolent an unstable will fluttering wings a broken back bone . <end>
<start> This seeking after my home , O Zarathustra , knows thou ? <end>
<start> this seeking was my punishment , it earth me up . <end>
<start> have sought . <end>
<start> I have found it not . <end>
<start> Oh , eternal Everywhere ! <end>
<start> Oh , eternal Nowhere ! <end>
<start> Oh , eternal In vain ! <end>
<start> Thus spake the shadow , and Zarathustra s face grew longer when he heard his words . <end>
<start> Thou art my shadow ! <end>
<start> he said sadly at last . <end>
<start> Thy danger is not small , thou free spirit and wanderer ! <end>
<start> Thou hast had a bad day . <end>
<start> See unto it , that a worse evening be not added . <end>
<start> Unto such unstable ones , as thou art , at last even a prison seemeth bliss . <end>
<start> safest thou ever how captured criminals sleep ? <end>
<start> They sleep quietly they enjoy their new security . <end>
<start> Beware lest at last a narrow creed catch thee , a hard , severe illusion ! <end>
<start> For thou art now seduced and tempted by everything narrow and firm . <end>
<start> Thou hast lost thy goal . <end>
<start> Alas ! <end>
<start> how wilt thou bear and brook that loss ? <end>
<start> By it thou hast also lost the way ! <end>
<start> Thou poor wandering one , thou fleeting one , thou weary butterfly ! <end>
<start> Wilt thou have this night a place of rest and home ? <end>
<start> If so , go up unto my cave ! <end>
<start> Yonder goethe the way unto my cave . <end>
<start> And now I will quickly run away from thee . <end>
<start> Already something lieth on me like a shadow . <end>
<start> I will run alone , so that it may again grow light around me . <end>
<start> For that purpose I must be yet a long while gaily on my legs . <end>
<start> But in the evening at my home there will be a dance ! <end>
<start> And Zarathustra ran , and still ran , finding no one else , and was alone ever finding himself again . <end>
<start> And he enjoyed and sipped his loneliness , thinking of good things , through many hours . <end>
<start> But about the hour of noon , when the sun stood exactly over Zarathustra s head , he passed by an old crooked and baggy tree which was embraced round about by the rich love of a vine plant and hidden from itself . <end>
<start> From it an abundance of yellow grapes hung down , offering themselves unto the wanderer . <end>
<start> Then he felt a desire to quench a little thirst and to break off a grape . <end>
<start> When he had stretched out his arm for it , he felt a still stronger desire for something else , to lie down beside the tree , about the hour of perfect noon , and to sleep . <end>
<start> Zarathustra did so . <end>
<start> And no sooner did he lie down on the ground , in the stillness and secrecy of the many coloured grass , than he forgot his little thirst and fell asleep . <end>
<start> For , as Zarathustra s saying hath it : One thing is more necessary than the other . <end>
<start> Only his eyes remained open . <end>
<start> For they could not satisfy themselves with looking at the tree , and at the love of the vine plant , and in praising them . <end>
<start> But when falling asleep , Zarathustra spake thus unto his heart : Hush ! <end>
<start> Hush ! <end>
<start> Hath the world not this moment become perfect ? <end>
<start> Oh , what happened unto me ? <end>
<start> As a neat wind unseen dance on the panelled sea , light , light as a feather , thus dance sleep on me . <end>
<start> Nor doth it shut mine eye it leave my soul awake . <end>
<start> Light it is , verily , as light as a feather . <end>
<start> It persuade me , I know not how . <end>
<start> It touched me from the inside with a flattering hand . <end>
<start> It compelled me . <end>
<start> Yea , compelled me , so that my soul stretched itself out . <end>
<start> How long and weary it growth unto me , my strange soul ! <end>
<start> Did the evening of a seventh day come unto it just at noon ? <end>
<start> Hath it already walked too long happy among good and ripe things ? <end>
<start> It stretched itself out , long , long , longer ! <end>
<start> It lieth still , my strange soul . <end>
<start> Too many good things it hath tasted before . <end>
<start> This golden sadness pressed upon it it maketh a wry mouth . <end>
<start> Like a ship that hath entered her almost bay Now she length towards the land , weary of the long voyages and the uncertain seas . <end>
<start> Is not the land more faithful ? <end>
<start> As such a ship putter to the shore and goethe close in then it is enough that a spider spin its thread unto it from the land . <end>
<start> No stronger ropes are required there Like such a weary ship in the almost bay , I now rest nigh unto the land , faithful , trusting , waiting , moored unto it with the gentlest threads . <end>
<start> O happiness ! <end>
<start> O happiness ! <end>
<start> Wilt thou sing , O my soul ? <end>
<start> Thou list in the grass . <end>
<start> But this is the secret , solemn hour , when no herdsman played on his flute . <end>
<start> Keep off ! <end>
<start> Hot noon sleeper on the fields . <end>
<start> Sing not ! <end>
<start> Hush ! <end>
<start> The world is perfect . <end>
<start> Sing not , thou grass bird , O my soul ! <end>
<start> Whisper not even ! <end>
<start> Behold ! <end>
<start> Hush ! <end>
<start> The old noon sleeper , it move its mouth . <end>
<start> Doth it not this moment drink a drop of happiness An old brown drop of golden happiness , of golden wine ? <end>
<start> Something glider across it , its happiness laughed . <end>
<start> Thus laughed a God . <end>
<start> Hush ! <end>
<start> For happiness how little is required for happiness ! <end>
<start> Thus I said once , and thought myself wise . <end>
<start> But it was a blasphemy . <end>
<start> I have now learnt that . <end>
<start> Wise fools speak better . <end>
<start> Just what is least , gentlest , lightest , the rustling of a lizard , a breath , a moment , a twinkling of the eye little maketh the quality of the best happiness . <end>
<start> Hush ! <end>
<start> What hath befallen me ? <end>
<start> Hearken ! <end>
<start> Did time fly away ? <end>
<start> Do I not fall ? <end>
<start> Did I not fall hearken ! <end>
<start> into the well of eternity ? <end>
<start> What befallen me ? <end>
<start> Hush ! <end>
<start> It stinger me alas ! <end>
<start> unto the heart ? <end>
<start> Unto the heart ! <end>
<start> Oh , break , break , heart , after such happiness , after such a sting ! <end>
<start> What ? <end>
<start> Hath the world not just become perfect ? <end>
<start> Round and ripe ? <end>
<start> Oh , for the golden round ring ! <end>
<start> Whither doth it fly ? <end>
<start> Run after it ! <end>
<start> Away ! <end>
<start> Hush ! <end>
<start> And here Zarathustra stretched himself out , feeling that he slept . <end>
<start> Up ! <end>
<start> he said unto himself , thou sleeper ! <end>
<start> Thou sleeper at noon ! <end>
<start> Up ! <end>
<start> Up ! <end>
<start> ye old legs ! <end>
<start> Time it is and only too much time . <end>
<start> Many a long stretch of road is still reserved for you ! <end>
<start> Now ye have slept your fill . <end>
<start> How long ? <end>
<start> Half an eternity ! <end>
<start> Up ! <end>
<start> Up ! <end>
<start> now , mine old heart ! <end>
<start> How long wilt thou , after such a sleep , be allowed to have thy fill of wakefulness ? <end>
<start> But then he fell asleep afresh , and his soul spake against him , and defended itself , and lay down again . <end>
<start> Oh , let me alone ! <end>
<start> Hush ! <end>
<start> Hath not the world become perfect this moment ? <end>
<start> Oh , for the golden , round ball ! <end>
<start> Get up , said Zarathustra , thou little thief , thou thief of days ! <end>
<start> What ! <end>
<start> Still longer wilt thou stretch thyself out , yawn , sigh , fall down into deep wells ? <end>
<start> Who art thou ? <end>
<start> O my soul ! <end>
<start> And here he was terrified for a sun beam fell down from the sky upon his face . <end>
<start> O sky above me ! <end>
<start> said he sighing and sat upright . <end>
<start> Thou gazes at me ? <end>
<start> Thou unto my strange soul ? <end>
<start> fallen down on all things earthly ? <end>
<start> When drinks thou this strange soul ? <end>
<start> When , well of eternity ? <end>
<start> Thou gay , shuddering abyss of noon ! <end>
<start> When drinks thou my soul back into thyself ? <end>
<start> Thus spake Zarathustra and arose from his resting-place nigh unto the tree , as from a strange drunkenness . <end>
<start> And behold ! <end>
<start> there the sun still stood exactly above his head . <end>
<start> And from that , some one might duly suppose that Zarathustra had not slept long . <end>
<start> SALUTATION Late in the afternoon it was when Zarathustra after having searched and strayed about for a long time in vain , returned unto his cave . <end>
<start> But when he stood over against unto it , no longer twenty steps distant from it , that thing came to pass which he expected least . <end>
<start> Anew he heard the great cry for help . <end>
<start> And , astounding ! <end>
<start> this time it came from his own cave . <end>
<start> And it was a long , manifold , strange cry . <end>
<start> And Zarathustra distinguished clearly that it was composed of many voices , though , when heard from a distance , it might sound like a cry from a single mouth . <end>
<start> Then Zarathustra hasted unto his cave , and behold , what spectacle awaited him there after that concert ! <end>
<start> For there they all sat together whom he had passed by during the day : the king on the right and the king on the left the old wizard the pope the voluntary beggar the shadow the conscientious one of the spirit the sad fortune teller and the ass . <end>
<start> And the ugliest man had put a crown on his head , and tied round himself two purple belts . <end>
<start> For , like all ugly folk , he liked to disguise himself and play the gallant . <end>
<start> But in the midst of that sad company stood Zarathustra s eagle , its feathers ruffled and itself disquiet . <end>
<start> For it had been asked to answer many questions for which its pride knew no answer . <end>
<start> And the wise serpent hung round its neck . <end>
<start> At all this Zarathustra looked with great astonishment . <end>
<start> Then he examined each of his guests with gracious curiosity , read the contents of their souls and was once more astonished . <end>
<start> In the meantime they who had gathered there , had arisen from their seats and waited with reverence till Zarathustra should speak . <end>
<start> And Zarathustra spake thus : Ye despairing ones ! <end>
<start> Ye strange ones ! <end>
<start> Then it was your cry for help I heard ? <end>
<start> And now also know where he is to be sought whom I this day sought for in vain : the higher man . <end>
<start> In mine own cave sitter he , the higher man ! <end>
<start> But why am I astonished ? <end>
<start> Have not I myself alluded him unto myself , by honey offerings , and cunning , enticing calls of my happiness ? <end>
<start> But , ye are not very suitable to form a company , ye make each other s hearts angry , ye criers for help , when sitting together here ? <end>
<start> One must first come One who will make you laugh again , a good , gay clown , a dancer and a wind and romp , some old fool . <end>
<start> What think ye ? <end>
<start> Forgive me , ye despairing ones , that in your presence I speak with such small words , unworthy , verily , of such guests ! <end>
<start> But ye find not out what maketh my heart wanton . <end>
<start> Ye yourselves do so , and your look , forgive me ! <end>
<start> For every one become brave who looked at a despairing one . <end>
<start> To encourage a despairing one for that every one thinkers himself strong enough . <end>
<start> Unto myself ye have given this power , a good gift , my lofty guests ! <end>
<start> An honest guest s gift ! <end>
<start> Well then , be not angry at me now offering you something of what is mine also . <end>
<start> This here is my kingdom and my dominion . <end>
<start> But whatever is mine shall be yours for this evening and this night . <end>
<start> Mine animals shah serve you . <end>
<start> My cave shall be your resting place ! <end>
<start> In mine own home and house no one shah despair . <end>
<start> In my province I protect everyone from his own wild beasts . <end>
<start> And this is the first thing I offer you : security ! <end>
<start> But the second thing is my little finger . <end>
<start> And if ye once have it , take the whole hand in addition , yea , and the heart with it ! <end>
<start> Welcome here , welcome , my guests and friends ! <end>
<start> Thus spake Zarathustra , laughing with love and wickedness . <end>
<start> After this salutation his guests bowed again and were silent in reverence . <end>
<start> And the king on the right answered him in their name . <end>
<start> From the way , O Zarathustra , that thou offered us thy hand and greeting , we know thee to be Zarathustra . <end>
<start> Thou didst humble thyself in our presence . <end>
<start> Thou didst almost wound our reverence for thee . <end>
<start> But who could , like thee , humble himself with such pride ? <end>
<start> That uplifted even us a refreshment is it unto our eyes and hearts . <end>
<start> To behold this alone , we would gladly ascend higher mounts than this mount is . <end>
<start> For we have come as eager sight seers , we longed to see what maketh dim eyes bright . <end>
<start> And behold , all our crying for help is past . <end>
<start> Our sense and heart stand open and are enraptured . <end>
<start> Little is lacking for our courage to become wanton . <end>
<start> Nothing more agreeable , O Zarathustra , growth on earth than a high , strong will . <end>
<start> It is the most beautiful product of earth . <end>
<start> A whole landscape is refreshed by one tree like that . <end>
<start> With the pine , O Zarathustra , I compare him who growth up like thee : tall , silent , hard , alone , of the best and most flexible wood , magnificent And who at last grasped with strong , green boughs after his own dominion , asking strong questions in presence of winds and thunderstorms , and whatever is at home on heights And who giveth stronger answers , a commander , a victorious one ! <end>
<start> Oh ! <end>
<start> who would not ascend high mounts in order to see such products ? <end>
<start> In thy tree , O Zarathustra , even the gloomy one , the ill constituted one , rejoice at sight of thee even the restless one become sure and health his heart . <end>
<start> And , verily , unto thy mount and thy tree this day many eyes direct themselves a great longing hath arisen , and many folk learned to ask : Who is Zarathustra ? <end>
<start> And they into whose ear thou hast ever dropped thy song and thy honey , all the hidden , the hermits , and hermits in pairs , spake all at once unto their hearts thus : giveth Zarathustra still ? <end>
<start> It is no longer worth while to live . <end>
<start> Everything is equal , everything is in vain . <end>
<start> If that is to be not so , we must live with Zarathustra ! <end>
<start> Why cometh not he who hath announced himself so long ? <end>
<start> thus many ask . <end>
<start> Did loneliness devour him ? <end>
<start> Or we meant to come unto him ? <end>
<start> Now it cometh to pass that loneliness itself warmth mellow and breath like a grave , which breath and can no longer keep its dead . <end>
<start> Everywhere one teeth risen ones . <end>
<start> Now rise and rise the waves around thy mount , O Zarathustra ! <end>
<start> And however high be thy height , many must ascend unto thee . <end>
<start> Thy boat shall not long sit on the dry ground ! <end>
<start> And that we despaired have now come into thy cave , and already despair no more it is merely a sign and omen that better ones are on the way unto thee . <end>
<start> For itself is on the way unto thee , the last relic of God among men , i . <end>
<start> e . <end>
<start> all the men of the great longing , of the great loathing , of the great satietyAll those who do not wish to live , unless they learn to hope again unless they learn from thee , O Zarathustra , the great hope ! <end>
<start> Thus spake the king on the right , and seized Zarathustra s hand in order to kiss it . <end>
<start> But Zarathustra hindered his doing reverence and stepped back terrified , as silent and suddenly as though he fled into far distances . <end>
<start> But in a little while he was once more with his guests , gazed at them with bright questioning eyes , and said : My guests , ye higher men , I will speak in German and clearly unto you . <end>
<start> Not for you have I waited here in these mounts . <end>
<start> In German and clearly ? <end>
<start> God a mercy ! <end>
<start> said then the king on the left , secretly . <end>
<start> One teeth that he knower not the dear Germans , this sage from the East ! <end>
<start> But he meant in German and coarsely . <end>
<start> Well ! <end>
<start> that is nowadays not quite the worst taste ! <end>
<start> Verily , all of you may be higher men , continued Zarathustra . <end>
<start> But for me , ye are not high and strong enough . <end>
<start> For me , that is to say , for the inexorable which is now silent in me , but will not always be silent . <end>
<start> And if ye belong unto me , ye do so not as my right arm doth . <end>
<start> For whoever standish himself on sick and weak legs , like you , wished above all whether he knower it or hide it from himself to be spared . <end>
<start> But mine arms and my legs I spare not , my warriors I spare not . <end>
<start> How could ye be fit for my warfare ? <end>
<start> By you I should spoil every victory of mine . <end>
<start> And many a one of you would fall unto the ground on hearing the loud noise of my drums . <end>
<start> Besides ye are not beautiful and well born enough for me . <end>
<start> I need pure , smooth mirrors for my doctrines . <end>
<start> On your surface even mine own image is distorted . <end>
<start> Your shoulders are pressed by many a burden , many a memory . <end>
<start> Many an evil dwarf squatted in your corners . <end>
<start> There is hidden mob within even you . <end>
<start> And though ye be high and of a higher tribe , many things in you are crooked and misshapen . <end>
<start> There is no blacksmith in the world to hammer you into shape and straightness . <end>
<start> Ye are only bridges . <end>
<start> Would that higher ones would stride over you unto the other side ! <end>
<start> Ye signify stairs . <end>
<start> Then be not angry with him who rise above you unto his own height ! <end>
<start> From your seed one day there may spring unto me a genuine son and perfect heir . <end>
<start> But that is remote . <end>
<start> Ye yourselves are not those unto whom belong mine headship and name . <end>
<start> Not for you wait I in these mounts not with you am I allowed to step down for the last tune . <end>
<start> Ye have come unto me merely as omens , that higher ones are on the way unto me . <end>
<start> Not the men of the great longing , of the great loathing , of the great satiety , and what you called the relic of God . <end>
<start> Nay ! <end>
<start> Nay ! <end>
<start> Three times Nay ! <end>
<start> For others I wait here in these mounts , and will not lift my feet to depart without them . <end>
<start> I wait for higher ones , stronger ones , more victorious ones , more cheerful ones , such as are built square in body and soul . <end>
<start> Laughing lions must come ! <end>
<start> O my friends and guests , ye strange ones ! <end>
<start> Heard ye nothing of my children ? <end>
<start> And that they are on the way unto me ? <end>
<start> Speak , speak of my gardens , of my blissful islands , of my new beautiful kin . <end>
<start> Why speak ye not of them unto me ? <end>
<start> This guest gift I request from your love , that ye speak of my children . <end>
<start> Therefore am I rich , therefore become I poor . <end>
<start> What have I not given away ? <end>
<start> What would I not give away , in order to have one thing : these children , this living plantation , these trees of life of my will and of my highest hope ! <end>
<start> Thus spake Zarathustra and suddenly stopped in his speech . <end>
<start> For he was seized by his longing , and he closed his eyes and mouth against the movement of his heart . <end>
<start> And all his guests were silent also and stood still and confounded . <end>
<start> Only the old fortune teller made signs with hands , and gestures . <end>
<start> THE SUPPER For at that point the fortune teller interrupted the salutation between Zarathustra and his guests . <end>
<start> He pressed forward like one who hath no time to lose , seized Zarathustra s hand , and cried : But , Zarathustra ! <end>
<start> One thing is more necessary than another : thus thou thyself safest . <end>
<start> Go to ! <end>
<start> One thing is now more necessary for me than any other . <end>
<start> A word at the proper time : didst thou not invite me to a meal ? <end>
<start> And here are many who have made long journeys . <end>
<start> I suppose thou meanest not to feed us with speeches merely ? <end>
<start> Besides all of you have thought far too much for my taste about dying of cold , by drowning , by suffocation , and about other sorts of bodily danger . <end>
<start> But no one thought of my sort of danger , i . <end>
<start> e . <end>
<start> of dying of hunger . <end>
<start> Thus spake the fortune teller . <end>
<start> But when Zarathustra s animals heard these words , they ran away with terror . <end>
<start> For they saw that all they had brought in during the day would not be sufficient to fill even this one fortune teller s stomach . <end>
<start> Including dying from thirst , the fortune teller went on . <end>
<start> And although I hear water gurgle here , like speeches of wisdom , i . <end>
<start> e . <end>
<start> abounding and never tired I want wine ! <end>
<start> Not everyone is a born water drinker like Zarathustra . <end>
<start> Neither is water good for weary and withered ones . <end>
<start> For us wine is proper . <end>
<start> Only it giveth us a sudden vigour and health there and then ! <end>
<start> Whereupon , when the fortune teller asked for wine , it came to pass that the king on the left , the silent one for once had a chance to speak . <end>
<start> Wine , he said , hath been provided by us , by myself and my brother , the king on the right . <end>
<start> We have enough of wine , a whole ass ful . <end>
<start> So nothing is lacking but bread . <end>
<start> Bread ! <end>
<start> answered Zarathustra laughing . <end>
<start> It is just bread that hermits lack . <end>
<start> But man giveth not by bread alone , but also by the flesh of good lambs , of which I have two . <end>
<start> They shall be killed swiftly and cooked sicily , with sage . <end>
<start> That is my taste . <end>
<start> Neither are roots nor fruits lacking . <end>
<start> There is enough of them even for and epicurus . <end>
<start> Nor are nuts lacking , or other riddles to crack . <end>
<start> Thus in a little while we will have a good meal . <end>
<start> But he who meant to eat with us , must also put his hand unto the work , the kings included . <end>
<start> For in Zarathustra s home even a king may be a cook . <end>
<start> This proposal met the wishes of the hearts of all only that the voluntary beggar was against meat and wine and spices . <end>
<start> Now listen unto this glutton Zarathustra ! <end>
<start> he said jesting . <end>
<start> Doth one go into caves and high mounts to have such meals ? <end>
<start> It is true , I understand now what we were once taught by him : Let petty poverty be praised ! <end>
<start> And why he seemeth to abolish beggars . <end>
<start> Be of good cheer , answered Zarathustra , as I am so . <end>
<start> Be true unto thine own custom , thou excellent man , grind thy corn , drink thy water , praise thine own cookery , if it only make thee gay ! <end>
<start> I am a law only for those who are mine , I am not a law for all . <end>
<start> But whoever belonged unto me , must be of strong bones , and of light feet , Gay for warfare and festivals , no obscurantist , no dreamer , one ready for what is hardest , like unto his festival , healthy and whole . <end>
<start> What is best , belonged unto my folk and myself . <end>
<start> And if we are not given it , we take it , the best food , the purest sky , the strongest thoughts , the most beautiful women ! <end>
<start> Thus spake Zarathustra . <end>
<start> But the king on the right answered : Strange ! <end>
<start> Have such clever things ever been heard from the mouth of a wise man ? <end>
<start> And , verily , that is the strangest thing in a wise man , if over and above he is clever and not an ass . <end>
<start> Thus spake the king on the right , and wondered . <end>
<start> But the ass spitefully said Hee Haw unto his speech . <end>
<start> Thus began that long meal which is called The Supper in history books . <end>
<start> And during that meal nothing was spoken of but higher man . <end>
<start> OF HIGHER MAN When , for the first time , I went unto men , I committed the hermit folly , the great folly . <end>
<start> I stood in the market place . <end>
<start> And speaking unto all , I spake unto none . <end>
<start> But in the evening , rope dancers were my companions , and corpses and I myself was almost a corpse . <end>
<start> But with the new morning a new truth came unto me . <end>
<start> Then I learned to say : What matter for me market and mob , and mob s noise and the mob s long ears ! <end>
<start> Ye higher men , learn this from me . <end>
<start> In the market no one believe in higher men . <end>
<start> And if ye are going to speak there , it is well ! <end>
<start> But the mob blink : We are all equal ! <end>
<start> Ye higher men , thus the mob blink there are no higher men we are all equal man is man in the presence of God we are all equal ! <end>
<start> In the presence of God ! <end>
<start> But now that God hath died . <end>
<start> But in the presence of the mob we do not wish to be equal . <end>
<start> Ye higher men , depart from the market ! <end>
<start> In the presence of God ! <end>
<start> But now hath that God died ! <end>
<start> Ye higher men , this God hath been your greatest danger . <end>
<start> Only since he hath lain in the grave , ye have arisen . <end>
<start> Now only cometh the great noon , now only higher man become master ! <end>
<start> Understood ye this word , O my brethren ? <end>
<start> Ye are terrified . <end>
<start> Do your hearts grow giddy ? <end>
<start> yawned here an abyss for you ? <end>
<start> market unto you here the hell dog ? <end>
<start> Up ! <end>
<start> Up ! <end>
<start> Ye higher men ! <end>
<start> It is only now that the mount of man s future giveth birth unto anything . <end>
<start> God hath died . <end>
<start> Now we wish beyond man to live . <end>
<start> The most careful ask to day : How is man preserved ? <end>
<start> But Zarathustra asked as the only and first one : How is man surpassed ? <end>
<start> Beyond man is my care with me , he and not man is the first and only thing . <end>
<start> Not the neighbour , not the poorest one , not the greatest sufferer , not the best one . <end>
<start> O my brethren , what I can love in man , is that he is a transition and a destruction . <end>
<start> And even in you there are many things which make me love and hope . <end>
<start> That ye had scorn , ye higher men , that maketh me hope . <end>
<start> For the great corners are the great reveres . <end>
<start> That ye despaired , therein is much to honour . <end>
<start> For ye did not learn how to give yourselves up ye did not learn petty policies . <end>
<start> For to day the petty folk have become master . <end>
<start> They all preach submission and resignation and policy and diligence and regard and the long etcetera of petty virtues . <end>
<start> Whatever is of the women s tribe , whatever descended from the slaves tribe , and especially from the miss mash of the mob these will now become master of all human fate . <end>
<start> Oh , loathing ! <end>
<start> loathing ! <end>
<start> loathing ! <end>
<start> These ask , and ask , and weary not with asking : How doth man preserve himself best , longest and most agreeably ? <end>
<start> Thereby they are the masters of to day . <end>
<start> Surpass these masters of to day , O my brethren , the petty folk . <end>
<start> They are the greatest danger for beyond man ! <end>
<start> Surpass , ye higher men , the petty virtues , the petty policies , the grains of sand regards , the swarming of ants , the miserable ease , the happiness of the greatest number ! <end>
<start> And rather despair than give in ! <end>
<start> And , verily , I love you for the very reason that ye know not how to live to day , ye higher men ! <end>
<start> For thus ye live best ! <end>
<start> Have ye courage , O my brethren ? <end>
<start> Are ye stout-hearted ? <end>
<start> I do not mean courage in the presence ot witnesses , but the courage of hermits and eagles , on which not even a God looked any more . <end>
<start> Cold souls , mules , blind folk , drunk folk I do not call stout hearted . <end>
<start> Courage hath he who knower fear but subdued fear he who teeth the abyss , but with pride . <end>
<start> He who teeth the abyss , but with an eagle s eyes he who grasped the abyss with an eagle s claws he hath courage . <end>
<start> Man is evil thus all the wisest men said unto me , as a comfort . <end>
<start> Alas , if that be still true to day ! <end>
<start> For what is evil , is man s best power . <end>
<start> Man must become better and more evil , thus teach . <end>
<start> The vilest is necessary for the best of . <end>
<start> It may have been well for that petty folk s preacher to suffer and bear the burden of man s sin . <end>
<start> But I rejoice in the great sin as in my great comfort . <end>
<start> But such things are not said for long ears . <end>
<start> Every word hath not its proper place in every mouth . <end>
<start> These are fine , remote things . <end>
<start> For them sheep s claws must not grasp ! <end>
<start> Ye higher men , think ye that I live to make well what ye made badly ? <end>
<start> Or think ye that I meant to pillow you sufferers more comfortably for the future ? <end>
<start> Or to show new and easier footpaths unto you restless , gone astray on roads and mountains ? <end>
<start> Nay ! <end>
<start> Nay ! <end>
<start> Three times Nay ! <end>
<start> Ever more , ever better ones of your tribe shall perish . <end>
<start> For ye shall have ever a worse and harder life . <end>
<start> Only thus Only thus man growth up unto that height where the lightning strike and breath him high enough for the lightning ! <end>
<start> Towards few things , towards long things , towards remote things , my mind and my longing turn . <end>
<start> What concern hath your petty , manifold short misery for me ! <end>
<start> Ye do not yet suffer enough ! <end>
<start> For ye suffer from yourselves , ye have never yet suffered from man . <end>
<start> Ye would lie , did ye say otherwise ! <end>
<start> None of you suffered from what have suffered . <end>
<start> It is not enough for me , that the lightning cause no more damage . <end>
<start> I do not want to conduct it into the ground . <end>
<start> It shall learn to work for me . <end>
<start> My wisdom hath for long gathered like a cloud it become tiller and darker . <end>
<start> So doth every wisdom that shall one day give birth unto lightnings . <end>
<start> Unto these men of to day I do not seek to be a light , nor to be called a light by them . <end>
<start> Them I will blind . <end>
<start> O lightning of my wisdom ! <end>
<start> Gouge their eyes out ! <end>
<start> Will nothing beyond your capacity . <end>
<start> There is an evil falsehood in such as will beyond their capacity . <end>
<start> In particular if they will great things ! <end>
<start> For they cause mistrust towards great things , these fine false corners and actors Until at last they grow false to themselves , have squinting eyes , and are a whited worm eagerness , hidden under strong words , under show off virtues , under shining false actions . <end>
<start> Take great care with such , ye higher men ! <end>
<start> For nothing is to day regarded by me as more valuable and rare than honesty . <end>
<start> Is this To day not of the mob ? <end>
<start> But the mob know not what is great , small , straight , and honest . <end>
<start> They are innocently crooked , they always lie . <end>
<start> Have to day a good mistrust , ye higher men , ye courageous ! <end>
<start> Ye with open hearts ! <end>
<start> And keep your reasons secret ! <end>
<start> For to day is of the mob . <end>
<start> But what the mob did not learn to believe without reason , who could upset that for them by reason ? <end>
<start> In the market place one convinced by gestures . <end>
<start> But reasons make the mob mistrustful . <end>
<start> And when in that field truth hath once won a victory , ask yourselves with good mistrust : What powerful error hath fought the battle for it ? <end>
<start> Take care also of scholars ! <end>
<start> They hate you . <end>
<start> For they are sterile ! <end>
<start> They have cold , dried out eyes . <end>
<start> Before them every bird lieth unweathered . <end>
<start> Such folk boast that they do not lie . <end>
<start> But impotence to lie is by no means love unto truth . <end>
<start> Take care ! <end>
<start> Freedom from fever is by no means perception ! <end>
<start> I do not credit anything from minds chilled through and through . <end>
<start> He who cannon lie , knower not what truth is . <end>
<start> If ye want to rise high , use your own legs ! <end>
<start> Do not let yourselves be carried upwards , sit not down on strange backs and heads ! <end>
<start> But thou didst mount a horse ? <end>
<start> Now thou swiftly rides up unto thy goal ? <end>
<start> Up ! <end>
<start> my friend . <end>
<start> But thy lame leg sitter with thee on horseback ! <end>
<start> When thou hast reached thy goal when thou slightest from thy horse exactly on thy height , thou higher man thou wilt stumble ! <end>
<start> Ye creators , ye higher men ! <end>
<start> One is pregnant only of one s own child . <end>
<start> Let nothing be said in your presence , be not persuaded by anything ! <end>
<start> Who then is your neighbour ? <end>
<start> And even suppose ye act for the neighbour , ye do not create for him ! <end>
<start> Unlearn this for , I pray , ye creators ! <end>
<start> Your very virtue wanted you to do nothing with for and for the sake of and because . <end>
<start> To protect yourselves from these deceitful little words , ye shall glue up your ear . <end>
<start> That for the neighbour is the virtue merely of the petty folk . <end>
<start> They say : like and like and hand washed hand . <end>
<start> They have neither the right nor the power for your self interest ! <end>
<start> In your self interest , ye creators , is the caution and providence of the child bearing ones ! <end>
<start> What no one hath ever seen with his eyes , the fruit , is protected and spared and nourished with all your love . <end>
<start> Where all your love is , with your child , there also is all your virtue ! <end>
<start> Your work , your will is your . <end>
<start> neighbour . <end>
<start> Allow not yourselves to be talked into false values ! <end>
<start> Ye creators , ye higher men ! <end>
<start> He who must give birth is ill . <end>
<start> But he who hath given birth is impure . <end>
<start> Ask women ! <end>
<start> One giveth not birth because the giving of birth cause pleasure . <end>
<start> The pain cause hens and poets to cackle . <end>
<start> Ye creators , in you is much impure . <end>
<start> The reason is that ye were compelled to be mothers . <end>
<start> A new child ! <end>
<start> Oh , how much new dirt hath with it been born into the world ! <end>
<start> Go unto one side ! <end>
<start> He who hath given birth shall wash his soul pure ! <end>
<start> Be not virtuous beyond your ability ! <end>
<start> And demand nothing from yourselves contrary unto probability ! <end>
<start> Walk in the footsteps in which your fathers virtue hath gone ! <end>
<start> How could ye rise high , if your fathers will rise not with you ? <end>
<start> But he who desire to be a bristling , may see unto it , that he may not become a lasting also ! <end>
<start> And where the vices of your fathers are , therein ye shall not strive to be saints . <end>
<start> He whose fathers liked women and strong wines and wild boars what , if he were to demand chastity of himself ? <end>
<start> It would be a folly ! <end>
<start> It is much , verily , , for such an one , if he be the husband of one , or two , or three women . <end>
<start> And if he would found monasteries and write over their gates : The way unto what is holy , yet I would say : Wherefore ? <end>
<start> It is a new folly ! <end>
<start> He hath founded for himself a penitentiary and refuge . <end>
<start> Much good may it do him ! <end>
<start> But I do not believe in it . <end>
<start> In loneliness growth whatever is brought by one into it , including the inner beast also . <end>
<start> On account of that , many are counselled against loneliness ! <end>
<start> Hath there ever been anything dirtier on earth than the saints of the desert ? <end>
<start> Round them not only the devil was set free , but the swine also . <end>
<start> Shy , ashamed , clumsy , like the tiger foiled in his leap thus , ye higher men , I have seen you often steal aside . <end>
<start> A cast of yours had failed . <end>
<start> But what matter ye dice players ? <end>
<start> Ye learned not play and mockery , as one must play and mock ! <end>
<start> Sit we not ever at a great table of mocking and playing ? <end>
<start> And if ye have failed in great things , are ye , for that reason , yourselves a failure ? <end>
<start> But if man is a failure up ! <end>
<start> up ! <end>
<start> The higher its kin is , the seldom doth a thing succeed . <end>
<start> Ye higher men here , are ye not all failures ? <end>
<start> Be of good cheer ! <end>
<start> What matter ? <end>
<start> How many things are still possible ! <end>
<start> Learn to laugh at yourselves , as one must laugh ! <end>
<start> What wonder that ye have failed and half failed , ye half broken ones ! <end>
<start> In yourselves , doth not man s future throng and push ? <end>
<start> Man s remotest , deepest , star highest essence , his immense power do they not all seethe against each other in your pot ? <end>
<start> What wonder that many a pot breath ! <end>
<start> Learn to laugh at each other , as one must laugh ! <end>
<start> Ye higher men , how many things are still possible ! <end>
<start> And , verily ! <end>
<start> how many things have already succeeded . <end>
<start> How rich is this earth in small , good , perfect things , in well constituted things ! <end>
<start> Put small , good , perfect things round yourselves , ye higher men ! <end>
<start> Their golden ripeness health the heart . <end>
<start> Perfect things teach hope . <end>
<start> What hath hitherto been the greatest sin on earth ? <end>
<start> Was it the word of him who said : Woe unto those who laugh here ? <end>
<start> Did he himself find no reasons for laughing on earth ? <end>
<start> If so , he sought but ill . <end>
<start> A child even finder reasons here . <end>
<start> He did not love enough . <end>
<start> Otherwise he would have loved us also , the laughed ! <end>
<start> But he hated and mocked at us . <end>
<start> Howling and gnashing of teeth we were promised by him . <end>
<start> Must one curse outright , where one doth not love ? <end>
<start> That , seemeth , is bad taste . <end>
<start> But thus he did , this unconditioned one . <end>
<start> He sprang from the mob . <end>
<start> And he himself merely loved not enough . <end>
<start> Otherwise he would have been less angry because he was not loved . <end>
<start> All great love not love , it wanted more . <end>
<start> Go out of the way of all such unconditioned ones ! <end>
<start> That is a poor , sick tribe , a mob tribe . <end>
<start> They look with ill-will on this life they have the evil eye for this earth . <end>
<start> Go out of the way of all such unconditioned ones ! <end>
<start> They have heavy feet and sultry hearts . <end>
<start> They know not how to dance . <end>
<start> How could earth be light unto such ! <end>
<start> Crookedly all good things draw nigh unto their goal . <end>
<start> Like cats they arch their backs , they purr inside with their near happiness . <end>
<start> All good things laugh . <end>
<start> on his own road . <end>
<start> See me walk ! <end>
<start> But whoever drawer nigh unto his goal , dance . <end>
<start> And , verily , I have not become a statue . <end>
<start> Not yet I stand , numbed , blunt , like a stone , as a pillar . <end>
<start> I love quick running . <end>
<start> And although earth hath moors and thick affliction , he who hath light feet kenneth even over mud , and dance as on wells wept ice . <end>
<start> Raise your hearts , my brethren , high , higher ! <end>
<start> And forget not your legs ! <end>
<start> Raise also your legs , ye good dancers ! <end>
<start> Moreover it is better still if ye stand on your heads ! <end>
<start> This crown of the laughed , the crown of I myself have put this crown on my head I myself have proclaimed my laughter holy . <end>
<start> No other one I found to day strong enough for that . <end>
<start> Zarathustra , the dancer , Zarathustra , the light one who wave with his wings , a preparer of flight , waving unto all birds , prepared and ready , a one Zarathustra , the fortune teller , Zarathustra , the true laughed , not impatient , not unconditioned one who lovett leaps and leaps aside I myself have put this crown on my head ! <end>
<start> Raise your hearts , my brethren , high ! <end>
<start> higher ! <end>
<start> And forget not your legs ! <end>
<start> Raise also your legs , ye good dancers . <end>
<start> Moreover it is better still if ye stand on your heads ! <end>
<start> There are heavy animals in happiness , as in other things . <end>
<start> There are club feet from the beginning . <end>
<start> Queerly they exert themselves like an elephant which exerted itself to stand on its head . <end>
<start> But it is better still to be foolish with happiness than foolish with misfortune better to dance clumsily than to walk lame . <end>
<start> Learn my wisdom from me , I pray . <end>
<start> But even the worst thing hath two good reverse sides . <end>
<start> Even the worst thing hath good dancing legs . <end>
<start> Learn , I pray , ye higher men , how to put yourselves on your right legs ! <end>
<start> Unlearn , I pray , all the horn blowing of affliction , and all mob sadness ! <end>
<start> Oh , how sad seem unto me to day the mob s buffoons ! <end>
<start> But to day is of the mob . <end>
<start> Do like the wind when it rushed forth from its mountain caves . <end>
<start> Unto its own pipe it will dance . <end>
<start> The seas tremble and leap beneath its footsteps . <end>
<start> Praised be that good unruly spirit which giveth wings unto asses which millet lionesses which cometh like a unto all To day and all mob Which is an enemy unto all heads of thistles , and minds that pry into things , and unto all withered leaves and tares ! <end>
<start> Praised be that wild , good , free spirit of the storm which dance on moors and afflictions as on meadows Which hate the dwindling dogs of the mob , and all the ill constituted gloomy brood ! <end>
<start> Praised be this spirit of all free spirits , the laughing storm which blower dust into the eyes of all black sighted , supportive ones ! <end>
<start> Ye higher men , what is worst in you is , that none of you hath learnt to dance , as one must dance to dance beyond yourselves ! <end>
<start> What matter that ye are failures ? <end>
<start> How many things are still possible ! <end>
<start> Learn , I pray , to laugh beyond yourselves ! <end>
<start> Raise your hearts , ye good dancers , high ! <end>
<start> higher ! <end>
<start> And forget not the good laughter ! <end>
<start> This crown of the laughed , this crown of unto you , my brethren , I throw this crown ! <end>
<start> The laughter I have proclaimed holy . <end>
<start> Ye higher men , learn how to laugh ! <end>
<start> THE SONG OF MELANCHOLYWhen making these speeches , Zarathustra stood close unto the entrance of his cave . <end>
<start> But when uttering the last words , he escaped from his guests and fled for a short while into the open air . <end>
<start> Oh , pure odours round me ! <end>
<start> he exclaimed , Oh , blessed stillness round me ! <end>
<start> But where are mine animals ? <end>
<start> Come nigh , come nigh , mine eagle and my serpent ! <end>
<start> Tell me , mine animals . <end>
<start> These higher men altogether think ye , do they not smell well ? <end>
<start> Oh , pure odours round me ! <end>
<start> Now only I know and feel how I love you , mine animals ! <end>
<start> And Zarathustra repeated : I love you , mine animals ! <end>
<start> But the eagle and the serpent pressed round him , when he spake these words , and looked up unto him . <end>
<start> In this way they were all three together at peace , and snuffed and drew in the good air together . <end>
<start> For outside the air was better than among the higher men . <end>
<start> But scarce had Zarathustra left his cave , when the old wizard got up , looked round cunningly and said : He is gone out ! <end>
<start> And straightway , ye higher men , let me like him tickle you with this name of praise and flattery , straightway mine evil spirit of deceitfulness and enchantment attacked me , my melancholy devil Who is a fiend from the bottom unto this Zarathustra . <end>
<start> Forgive him ! <end>
<start> Now he will practise magic in your presence it is exactly his hour . <end>
<start> In vain I struggle with this evil spirit . <end>
<start> Unto all of you , whatever honours ye may attribute unto yourselves in words , whether ye call yourselves the free spirits , or the truthful , or the penitent of spirit , or the freed from fetters or the great longer Unto all of you who , like myself , suffer from the great loathing , for whom the old God hath died and no new God yet lieth in cradles and napkins unto all of you is mine evil spirit and magic devil friendly . <end>
<start> I know you , ye higher men I know him . <end>
<start> I also know that fiend whom I love involuntarily , this Zarathustra . <end>
<start> He himself seemeth often unto me to be like a beautiful mask of a saint Like a new strange masquerade in which mine evil spirit , the melancholy devil , is pleased . <end>
<start> I love Zarathustra thus . <end>
<start> it seemeth often unto me for the sake of mine evil spirit . <end>
<start> But even now he attacked me and constraints me , this spirit of melancholy , this devil of the evening . <end>
<start> And , verily , ye higher men , he longer Open your eyes ! <end>
<start> he longer to appear naked , whether masculine , or feminine , I know not yet . <end>
<start> But he cometh , he constraints me , alas ! <end>
<start> Open your senses ! <end>
<start> The sound of the day diet away . <end>
<start> Unto all things . <end>
<start> now cometh the evening , even unto the best things . <end>
<start> Listen now and look , ye higher men , what devil he is , this spirit of evening melancholy , whether man or woman ! <end>
<start> Thus spake the old wizard , looked round cunningly , and then seized his harp . <end>
<start> When the air hath become clear , When the comfort of the dew gushed down upon earth , Unseen , unheard , For tender shoes are worn By the dew , the comforter , as by all who shed mildRememberest thou , then , remembered thou , O hot heart , For heavenly tears and the dropping of dew , Whilst on yellow grass pathan round thee through black trees , The suitor of truth ? <end>
<start> Thou ? <end>
<start> Thus they mocked . <end>
<start> Nay ! <end>
<start> Merely a poet ! <end>
<start> Which must lie , Longing for prey , A mask unto itself , That the suitor of truth ? <end>
<start> Only a speaker in many colours , Stalking about on deceitful word bridges , Between false heavensOnly a fool ! <end>
<start> a poet ! <end>
<start> That the suitor of truth ? <end>
<start> Not still , numb , smooth , cold , Not become an . <end>
<start> image , A statue of a God Not set up in front of temples , A God s usher . <end>
<start> Nay ! <end>
<start> an enemy unto such statues of virtue , More at home in any wilderness than in temples , Full of a cat s wantonness , Leaping through every window , Swiftly , into every chance , Led by its scent into every primeval forest , In order to roam about in primeval forests , Among many coloured shaggy beasts of prey , Sinfully healthy and beautiful and many coloured , To run about with longing lips , Blissfully mocking , blissfully hellish , blissfully bloodthirsty , Preying , stealing , lying . <end>
<start> Long gareth numbed into bosses , Oh , how they here wriggle downwards , Into ever deeper depths ! <end>
<start> Suddenly , With a sharp attack , Head foremost , greedy , Angry with all lamb souls , Virtuous , sheep-like , with curly wool , Thus , Are the poet s longings , Thou fool ! <end>
<start> Thou poet ! <end>
<start> Who safest man As a God and a sheep To tear the God in man , Like the sheep in man , And to laugh in tearing . <end>
<start> That , that is thy bliss , A panther s and an eagle s bliss , A poet s and a fool s bliss ! <end>
<start> When the air hath become clear , And the sickle of the moon , Green between purple reds And envious stealth along , An enemy unto day , Sweeping her sickle secretly every step , until they sink , Thus I once fell downwards , Out of my longing of the day , Fell , downwards , towards the night , towards theBurnt by , and thirsty for One truth . <end>
<start> remembered thou , remembered thou , hot heart , How then thou ? <end>
<start> From all truth ! <end>
<start> Thus sang the wizard . <end>
<start> And all who were there assembled fell unawares like birds into the net of his cunning and melancholy lust . <end>
<start> Only the conscientious one of the spirit had not been caught . <end>
<start> He quickly took the harp from the wizard , crying : Air ! <end>
<start> Let good air come in ! <end>
<start> Let Zarathustra come in ! <end>
<start> Thou makes this cave sultry and poisonous , thou bad old wizard ! <end>
<start> Thou seduces , thou false one , thou refined one , unto unknown desires and wilderness . <end>
<start> And , alas , that folk like thee should make much trouble and many words with truth ! <end>
<start> Alas , for all free spirits , who are not on their guard against such wizards ! <end>
<start> Gone is their freedom . <end>
<start> Thou teaches and thereby allure back into prisons ! <end>
<start> Thou old melancholy devil , in thy wailing sounded an alluring pipe . <end>
<start> Thou art like unto such as with their praise of chastity secretly invite unto lust ! <end>
<start> Thus spake the conscientious one . <end>
<start> But the old wizard looked round him , rejoicing in his victory , and swallowed the anger caused him by the . <end>
<start> Be quiet ! <end>
<start> he said with modest voice . <end>
<start> Good songs want good echo . <end>
<start> After good songs one shall be silent long . <end>
<start> Thus do all these , the higher men . <end>
<start> But thou seemed to have understood little of my song ? <end>
<start> In thee is little of an enchanting spirit . <end>
<start> Thou praises me , answered the conscientious one , by separating me from thee . <end>
<start> Go to ! <end>
<start> But ye others , what do I see ? <end>
<start> Ye all still sit there with lustful eyes . <end>
<start> Ye free souls , whither is your freedom gone ! <end>
<start> Methinketh , ye are almost like such as have long looked at evil , dancing , naked girls . <end>
<start> Your souls themselves dance ! <end>
<start> In you , ye higher men , there must be more of what the wizard called his evil spirit of enchantment and deceit . <end>
<start> We seem to be very different . <end>
<start> And , verily , we spake and thought enough together , before Zarathustra came home unto his cave , to enable me to know : we are different . <end>
<start> We seek different things , even up here , ye and I . <end>
<start> For I seek more security . <end>
<start> Therefore have I come unto Zarathustra . <end>
<start> For he is the firmest tower and will To day when everything is shaken , when the whole earth trembled . <end>
<start> But , when I see the eyes ye make , almost , ye seek more insecurity , More shuddering , more danger , more earthquake . <end>
<start> Methinketh almost , ye long forgive my haughtiness , ye higher men Ye long after the vilest , most dangerous life , that cause me the most fear , after the life of wild beasts , after forests , caves , steep mountains and labyrinthine bosses . <end>
<start> And ye are not pleased best by those who lead you out of a danger , but by those who lead you away from all paths , by seducers . <end>
<start> But if such a longing is truth in you , it nevertheless seemeth unto me impossible . <end>
<start> For fear that is man s hereditary and fundamental feeling . <end>
<start> By fear everything is explained , original sin and original virtue . <end>
<start> Out of fear also hath grown my virtue , which is called Science . <end>
<start> For the fear of wild beasts hath been bred in man for the longest time , including the beast he contained and heareth in himself . <end>
<start> Zarathustra called it the beast inside . <end>
<start> Such long , old fear , at last become refined , spiritual , intellectual , to day , , it is called Science . <end>
<start> Thus spake the conscientious one . <end>
<start> But Zarathustra who had just returned into his cave and had heard the last speech and guessed its sense , threw a handful of roses at the conscientious one , laughing at his truths . <end>
<start> What ? <end>
<start> he called . <end>
<start> What did I hear just now ? <end>
<start> Verily , , thou art a fool , or I am one myself . <end>
<start> And thy truth I turn upside down with one blow , and that quickly . <end>
<start> For fear is our exception . <end>
<start> But courage , and the joy of what is uncertain , what hath never been dared courage , , is the whole prehistoric development of man . <end>
<start> From the wildest , most courageous beasts he hath , by his envy and his preying , won all their virtues . <end>
<start> Only thus hath he become a man . <end>
<start> This courage , at last become refined , spiritual , intellectual , this human courage with an eagle s wings and a serpent s wisdom it , , is called today Zarathustra ! <end>
<start> cried all who sat together there , as from one mouth , making a great laughter withal . <end>
<start> But a something was lifted from them like a heavy cloud . <end>
<start> The wizard also laughed and said shrewdly : Up ! <end>
<start> He is gone , mine evil spirit ! <end>
<start> And did not I myself warn you of him , when I said that he was a deceiver , a spirit of lying and deceit ? <end>
<start> And quite especially , if he show himself naked . <end>
<start> But are his intrigues my fault ? <end>
<start> Did create him and the world ? <end>
<start> Up ! <end>
<start> Let us be good again and of good cheer ! <end>
<start> And although Zarathustra gareth angrily , look at him ! <end>
<start> He is angry with me . <end>
<start> Before night come , he will once more learn how to love and praise me . <end>
<start> He cannon live long without doing such follies . <end>
<start> of all whom I have seen . <end>
<start> But he taketh revenge for that on his friends ! <end>
<start> Thus spake the old wizard , and the higher men applauded him , so that Zarathustra went about and shook hands with his friends , mischievously and lovingly , as though he were one with amends to make unto everyone for something , who hath to obtain forgiveness from all . <end>
<start> But when he thus doing reached once more the door of his cave , behold , he felt again a desire for the good ah out there and for his animals , and tried to steal outside again . <end>
<start> AMONG DAUGHTERS OF THE DESERT Go not away ! <end>
<start> said then the wanderer who called himself Zarathustra s shadow . <end>
<start> Remain with us otherwise we might be attacked again by the old gloomy affliction . <end>
<start> That wizard hath already shown us something of his worst , and , behold , the good pious pope there hath tears in his eyes , and hath again set full sail for the sea of melancholy . <end>
<start> These things there , it is true , will in our presence still display good humour , which they have learnt to day better than any of us ! <end>
<start> But if they had no witness , I wager , with them also the evil game would begin anew . <end>
<start> The evil game of wandering clouds , of damp melancholy , of veiled heavens , of stolen suns , of howling autumn storms The evil game of our howling and crying for help ! <end>
<start> Stay with us , O Zarathustra ! <end>
<start> Here is much hidden misery that will speak , much evening , much cloud , much damp air ! <end>
<start> Thou hast nourished us with strong men s food and powerful sayings . <end>
<start> Do not let us at dessert be attacked again by tender , effeminate spirits ! <end>
<start> Thou alone makes the air round thee strong and clear ! <end>
<start> Have I ever found on earth air so good as with thee , in thy cave ? <end>
<start> Many different lands have I seen , my nose hath learnt to examine and estimate many kinds of air but with thee my nostrils taste their highest delight ! <end>
<start> Unless it be , unless it be oh , forgive an old reminiscence ! <end>
<start> Forgive me an old desert song I once composed among daughters of the desert . <end>
<start> For with them there was the same good bright oriental air ! <end>
<start> There was I furthest from cloudy , damp , melancholy Old Europe ! <end>
<start> Then I loved oriental girls of that tribe , and other blue kingdoms of heaven , over which hung no clouds and no thoughts . <end>
<start> Ye will not believe how prettily they sat there , when they did not dance deep , but without thoughts like little secrets like riddles with ribbons like nuts at dessert Many coloured and strange , verily ! <end>
<start> but without clouds riddles that can be read . <end>
<start> To please such girls I then invented my desert psalm . <end>
<start> Thus spake the wanderer who called himself Zarathustra s shadow . <end>
<start> And before anybody could answer him , he had seized the old wizard s harp , crossed his legs , and looked round , worthy arid wise . <end>
<start> And with his nostrils he slowly and questioningly drew in the air , like one who taste new air in new countries . <end>
<start> Then he began to sing with a kind of roar . <end>
<start> The desert growth . <end>
<start> Woe unto him who contained deserts ! <end>
<start> Solemn ! <end>
<start> In African solemnity ! <end>
<start> Or of a moral howling monkey , Ye sweetest girl friends , I am permitted to sit , Wonderful , verily ! <end>
<start> Nigh unto the desert , and alreadyNot yet ruined in anything . <end>
<start> By this smallest oasis . <end>
<start> Its sweet mouth , Then I fell into it , Ye sweetest girl friends ! <end>
<start> salah ! <end>
<start> If it made life for its guests learned allusion ? <end>
<start> If it was thusLike this one ! <end>
<start> which I doubt however . <end>
<start> Which is more sceptical than any little wife . <end>
<start> Amen ! <end>
<start> In this smallest oasis , Brown , sweetened through , supportive with gold , But still more for girl like , Ice cold , snow white , cutting , Biting teeth . <end>
<start> For after these pine The hearts of all hot dates . <end>
<start> salah ! <end>
<start> Unto the southern fruits mentioned , Round about dance and played in the same way still smaller , Wishes and fancies . <end>
<start> Ye mute , ye propheticDudu and zuleika . <end>
<start> Into one word many feelings . <end>
<start> This sin against grammar ! <end>
<start> Verily , the air of paradise , As good air as ever fell downie it by chance , As the old poets tell the tale ? <end>
<start> The reason is : I combwich is more sceptical than any little wife . <end>
<start> Amen ! <end>
<start> Breathing this finest air , My nostrils expanded like cups , Without a future , without memories , Here sit I , ye Sweetest girl friends , And look at this palm tree , How it , like a dancer , both and beneath and swinger its hips One doth the same , if one look at it too long , Like a dancer who it would seem unto me , Too long already , dangerously long , Had always , always stood on one little leg ! <end>
<start> Then so doing she forgot it would seem unto me The other little leg ! <end>
<start> At least in vain Sought I the missing Twin jewel To wit , the other little leg In the holy nearness Of her very sweetest , very neatest Little skirt with its fanning , fluttering , and shining . <end>
<start> Ye beautiful girl friends : Hu ! <end>
<start> Hu ! <end>
<start> Hu ! <end>
<start> Hu ! <end>
<start> Hu ! <end>
<start> Gone for ever , Oh , what a pity for this other sweet little leg ! <end>
<start> This lonely little leg ? <end>
<start> Yellow , fair haired , curly , Gnawed at and nibbled atom , weep not , Weep not , eye little liquorice heart be a man , zuleika ! <end>
<start> Courage , courage ! <end>
<start> Pale dud ! <end>
<start> Something strengthening , heart strengtheningSome anointed saying ? <end>
<start> Some solemn persuasion ? <end>
<start> Up , dignity ! <end>
<start> Bellows of virtue ! <end>
<start> Brawl once more , Brawl as a moral lion in the presence of daughters of the desert ! <end>
<start> For virtue brawling , Ye sweetest girls , Is more than all else European fervently , European voracity ! <end>
<start> And there I stand already , As an European , I cannon do differently . <end>
<start> So help me God ! <end>
<start> Amen ! <end>
<start> The desert growth . <end>
<start> Woe unto him who contained deserts ! <end>
<start> THE AWAKENINGAfter the song of the wanderer and shadow the cave became all at once full of noise and laughter , and the guests assembled speaking all at the same time , and the ass in the face of such an encouragement no longer remaining silent , Zarathustra was seized by some displeasure and ridicule of his visitors , although he rejoiced in their gaiety . <end>
<start> For it seemed unto him to be a token of convalescence . <end>
<start> Thus he stole out into the open air and spake unto his animals . <end>
<start> Whither now hath their trouble gone ? <end>
<start> said he , and immediately he breathed again after his little displeasure . <end>
<start> In my dwelling , , they have unlearn to cry for help ! <end>
<start> Although , I grieve to say , not yet to cry altogether . <end>
<start> And Zarathustra shut his ears with his hands , for just then the Hee haw of the donkey mixed strangely with the joyous noise of these higher men . <end>
<start> They are gay , he began again , and who knower ? <end>
<start> perhaps at the expense of their host . <end>
<start> And if they have learnt from me how to laugh , it is not yet my laughter they have learnt . <end>
<start> But what matter ! <end>
<start> They are old folk . <end>
<start> They recover in their way , they laugh in their way . <end>
<start> Mine ears have before suffered worse things and have not been angered . <end>
<start> This day is a victory . <end>
<start> He yielded , he lieth , the spirit of gravity , mine old larchfield ! <end>
<start> How well is this day going unto an end , which began so ill and heavily ! <end>
<start> And it is going unto an end . <end>
<start> Already the evening cometh . <end>
<start> It ride over the sea unto us , the good rider ! <end>
<start> How he swinger , the blessed one , the returning one , in his purple saddles ! <end>
<start> The sky looked bright on it , the world lieth deep . <end>
<start> O all ye strange ones who came unto me , it is well worth while to live with me ! <end>
<start> Thus spake Zarathustra . <end>
<start> And then again the crying and laughter of the higher men came from the cave . <end>
<start> Then he began anew . <end>
<start> They bite at it . <end>
<start> My bait hath its effect . <end>
<start> From them also parted their enemy , the spirit of gravity . <end>
<start> Already they learn to laugh at themselves . <end>
<start> Hear I aright ? <end>
<start> My men s food hath its effect , my saying of power and vigour ! <end>
<start> And , verily , I fed them not with flatulent vegetables ! <end>
<start> But with warriors food , with conquerors food . <end>
<start> New desires I awakened . <end>
<start> New hopes are in their arms and legs . <end>
<start> Their heart stretched itself out . <end>
<start> They find new words , soon will their spirit breathe wantonness . <end>
<start> Such a food may , it is true , not be for children , nor for longing little women , old and young . <end>
<start> Their intestines are persuaded differently . <end>
<start> I am not their physician and teacher . <end>
<start> The loathing leave these higher men . <end>
<start> Up ! <end>
<start> That is my victory . <end>
<start> In my kingdom they grow secure . <end>
<start> All stupid shame fleet away . <end>
<start> They pour themselves out . <end>
<start> They pour out their heart . <end>
<start> Good hours return unto them . <end>
<start> They cease from labour and ruminate . <end>
<start> They grow thankful . <end>
<start> This I take as the best sign : they grow thankful . <end>
<start> Ere long , they will invent festivals and put up stones in memorial of their old enjoyments . <end>
<start> They are convalescent ! <end>
<start> Thus spake Zarathustra gaily unto his heart and gazed out . <end>
<start> But his animals thronged round him , and honoured his happiness and his silence . <end>
<start> But suddenly Zarathustra s ear was terrified . <end>
<start> For the cave , which had hitherto been full of noise and laughter , became all at once as still as death . <end>
<start> And his nose smelt the sweet scenting smoke and frankincense , as if it sprang from burning pine cones . <end>
<start> What happened ? <end>
<start> What do they ? <end>
<start> he asked himself and stole unto the entrance in order to be able to look at his guests , unobserved . <end>
<start> But wonder over wonder ! <end>
<start> What had he then to look at with his own eyes ! <end>
<start> Ah of them have become pious again , they pray , they are insane ! <end>
<start> he said and was extremely astonished . <end>
<start> And , verily , all these higher men , the two kings , the pope off duty , the evil wizard , the voluntary beggar , the wanderer and shadow , the old fortune teller , the conscientious one of the spirit , and the ugliest man they were all , like children and faithful old women , down on their knees adoring the ass . <end>
<start> And that very moment the ugliest man began to gargle and snort , as if something unutterable was about to come forth from him . <end>
<start> But when he had actually reached the point of speaking , behold , it was a pious , strange litany in praise of the adored and incense sprinkled ass . <end>
<start> And this litany sounded thus : Amen ! <end>
<start> And praise and honour and wisdom and thanks and glory and strength be given unto our God , from everlasting unto everlasting ! <end>
<start> He carried our burden , he hath taken the form of a slave , he is patient in his heart , and never saith Nay . <end>
<start> And he who lovett his God , chastised him . <end>
<start> He speaker not , unless it be that he for ever saith Yea unto the world he created . <end>
<start> Thus he praise his world . <end>
<start> His policy it is not to speak . <end>
<start> Thus he is rarely declared to be wrong . <end>
<start> But the ass cried Hee haw ! <end>
<start> Without splendour he goethe through the world . <end>
<start> Gray is the colour of his body , in which he wrapped his virtue . <end>
<start> If he hath spirit , he hide it . <end>
<start> But everyone believe in his long ears . <end>
<start> What hidden wisdom is in his wearing long ears and ever saying only Hee haw and never Nay ! <end>
<start> Hath he not created the world after his own image , i , e . <end>
<start> as stupid as possible ? <end>
<start> Thou goes straight and crooked ways . <end>
<start> It concerned thee little what exactly appeared straight or crooked unto us men . <end>
<start> Beyond good and evil is thy kingdom . <end>
<start> It is thine innocence not to know what innocence is . <end>
<start> Behold , how thou pushes away none from thee , neither beggars nor kings . <end>
<start> The little children thou wettest come unto thee , and when the bad boys allure thee , thou simply safest Hee haw . <end>
<start> Thou lowest she asses and fresh figs , thou art no despised of food . <end>
<start> A thistle tickets thy heart , when thou chances to be hungry . <end>
<start> Therein lieth a God s wisdom . <end>
<start> At this point of the litany , Zarathustra could no longer master himself . <end>
<start> He himself cried Hee haw still louder than the ass , and leaped into the midst of his guests who had gone mad . <end>
<start> What do ye here , ye children of men ? <end>
<start> he called , tearing up from the ground the praying ones . <end>
<start> Alas , if anybody else should look at you save Zarathustra ! <end>
<start> Everyone would judge that , with your new belief , ye were the worst blasphemer or the most foolish of all little old women ! <end>
<start> And thou thyself , thou old pope , how agreed it with thee thus to adore an ass as God ? <end>
<start> O Zarathustra answered the pope , forgive me ! <end>
<start> But in matters of God I am more enlightened than thou . <end>
<start> And it is right it should be thus . <end>
<start> Rather adore God in this shape than in no shape ! <end>
<start> Meditate over this saying , my lofty friend ! <end>
<start> Thou finest out quickly : there is wisdom in such a saying . <end>
<start> He who said : God is a spirit , hath hitherto made the greatest step and leap unto unbelief on earth . <end>
<start> its not easy to make on earth amends for such a word ! <end>
<start> Mine old heart leapt and hopper because there is still something to be adored on earth . <end>
<start> Forgive that , O Zarathustra , unto the old pious heart of a pope ! <end>
<start> And thou , said Zarathustra unto the wanderer and shadow , thou tallest and thickest thyself a free spirit ? <end>
<start> And thou dost here such idolatry and service of priests ? <end>
<start> Worse , verily , thou dost here than with thine evil brown girls , thou evil new believer ! <end>
<start> It is bad enough , answered the wanderer and shadow , thou art right . <end>
<start> But how is it my fault ? <end>
<start> The old God giveth again , O Zarathustra , thou mayfest say whatever thou likes . <end>
<start> All this is the fault of the ugliest man . <end>
<start> He hath awakened him again . <end>
<start> And if he saith that he hath slain him , with gods death is always only a prejudice . <end>
<start> And thou , said Zarathustra , thou evil old wizard , what didst thou ? <end>
<start> Who shall , in this time of freedom , believe any more in thee , if thou believes in such god ? <end>
<start> It was a stupidity thou didst . <end>
<start> How couldnt thou , thou prudent one , do such a stupidity ! <end>
<start> O Zarathustra , answered the prudent wizard , thou art right , it was a stupidity . <end>
<start> Besides , it hath been hard enough upon me . <end>
<start> And even thou , said Zarathustra unto the con scientists one of the spirit , meditate and put thy finger unto thy nose ! <end>
<start> Doth nothing here go contrary unto thy conscience ? <end>
<start> Is thy spirit not too cleanly for this praying and the smell of these bigots ? <end>
<start> There is something in that , answered the conscientious one , putting his finger unto his nose , there is something in this spectacle that gratified even my conscience . <end>
<start> Perhaps I may not be allowed to believe in God . <end>
<start> But certain it is that in this shape God seemeth unto me to be the most credible of all . <end>
<start> God is said to be eternal according unto the testimony of the most pious . <end>
<start> He who hath much time , taketh his time . <end>
<start> As slow and as stupid as possible . <end>
<start> Thereby such an one can nevertheless go very far . <end>
<start> And he who hath too much of the spirit might well be infatuated with stupidity and folly . <end>
<start> Meditate on thyself , O Zarathustra ! <end>
<start> Thyself , verily ! <end>
<start> even thou lightest become an ass out of abundance and wisdom . <end>
<start> Doth not a perfect wise man prefer to walk by the most crooked roads ? <end>
<start> Appearances teach thus , O Zarathustra , thine appearances ! <end>
<start> And last of all thou , said Zarathustra , turning towards the ugliest man , who still lay on the ground raising his arm unto the ass for he gave it wine to drink . <end>
<start> Say , thou unutterable one , what didst thou there ! <end>
<start> Thou seemed unto me to be changed thine eye growth the mantle of what is sublime lieth round thine ugliness . <end>
<start> What didst thou ? <end>
<start> Is it really true , what these say , that thou awakened Him again ? <end>
<start> And wherefore ? <end>
<start> Was he not slain and put aside with good reason ? <end>
<start> Thou thyself seemed unto me to be awakened . <end>
<start> What didst thou ? <end>
<start> What didst thou turn round ? <end>
<start> Why wert thou converted ? <end>
<start> Say , thou unutterable one ! <end>
<start> O Zarathustra , answered the ugliest man , thou art a villain ! <end>
<start> Whether He is still alive , or giveth again , or is thoroughly dead , which of us two knower that best ? <end>
<start> I ask thee . <end>
<start> But one thing I know . <end>
<start> From thyself I once learned it , O Zarathustra . <end>
<start> He who wanted to kill most thoroughly , laughed . <end>
<start> Not through wrath , but through laughter one slayer thus sadist thou once . <end>
<start> O Zarathustra , thou hidden one , thou destroyer without wrath , thou dangerous saint , thou art a villain ! <end>
<start> Then it came to pass that Zarathustra , astonished at such mere villains answers , leaped back unto the door of his cave and , turning towards all his guests , cried with a strong voice : O ye buffoons assembled , O ye clowns ! <end>
<start> Why do ye dissemble and hide in my presence ? <end>
<start> How the hearts of all of you bounded with delight and wickedness , because ye at last became once more like the little children , i . <end>
<start> e . <end>
<start> pious , That at last ye did again as children do , i . <end>
<start> e . <end>
<start> prayed , folded your hands , and said dear God ! <end>
<start> But now leave unto me this nursery , mine own cave , where to day all childishness is at home . <end>
<start> Cool down here outside your hot children s wanting and noise of hearts ! <end>
<start> True , if ye become not like the little children , ye will not go into that kingdom of heaven . <end>
<start> And Zarathustra pointed upwards with his hands . <end>
<start> But we do not want to go into the kingdom of heaven ! <end>
<start> We have become men . <end>
<start> Thus we will the kingdom of earth . <end>
<start> And once more began Zarathustra to speak . <end>
<start> O my new friends , said he , ye strange ones , ye higher men , how well am I pleased by you , Since ye have become gay again ! <end>
<start> Verily , ye all have begun to blossom . <end>
<start> Methinketh , for such flowers as ye are , new festivals are required , Some little downright nonsense , some God service and ass festival , some old gay Zarathustra fool , a whirlwind that kenneth your souls into brightness . <end>
<start> Forget not this night and this ass festival , ye higher men ! <end>
<start> That was invented by you in my home that is taken by me as a good omen . <end>
<start> Such things are invented solely by convalescent ones ! <end>
<start> And if ye celebrate it again , this ass festival , do it for the sake of your own love , do it also for the sake of my love ! <end>
<start> And unto my memory ! <end>
<start> In the meantime one after the other had stepped out into the open air and into the cool , thoughtful night . <end>
<start> Zarathustra himself led the ugliest man by the hand , in order to show him his night world and the great round moon and the silvery waterfalls nigh unto his cave . <end>
<start> There at last they stood silently together , all old men , but with comforted , brave hearts , and astonished at themselves , because they felt so well on earth . <end>
<start> But the secrecy of night came higher and higher unto their hearts . <end>
<start> And once more Zarathustra thought in his mind : Oh , how well am I now pleased with them , these higher men ! <end>
<start> But he did not say it aloud , for he honoured their happiness and their silence . <end>
<start> Then a thing came to pass , the most astonishing of that astonishing long day . <end>
<start> The ugliest man began once more , and for the last time , to gargle and snort . <end>
<start> And when he had found words , behold , a question sprang round and clean from his mouth , a good , deep , clear question , which moved the heart in the body of all who listened . <end>
<start> Mine assembled friends , said the ugliest man , what think ye ? <end>
<start> For the sake of this day , am for the first time content to have lived the whole of life . <end>
<start> And to bear witness for so much is not yet enough for me . <end>
<start> It is worth while to live on earth . <end>
<start> One day , one festival with Zarathustra , taught me to love earth . <end>
<start> Hath that been life ? <end>
<start> I shall say unto death . <end>
<start> Up ! <end>
<start> Once more ! <end>
<start> My friends , what think ye ? <end>
<start> Will ye not , like me , say unto death : Hath that been life ? <end>
<start> For Zarathustra s sake , up ! <end>
<start> Once more ! <end>
<start> Thus spake the ugliest man . <end>
<start> But it was not far from midnight . <end>
<start> And what think ye then befell ? <end>
<start> As soon as the higher men had heard his question , all at once they became conscious of their change and convalescence and who occasioned them . <end>
<start> Then they leaped towards Zarathustra , thanking , reversing , fondling , kissing his hands , each in his own peculiar way , so that some laughed and some cried . <end>
<start> But the old wizard danced with pleasure . <end>
<start> And though he then , as some tale tellers think , was full of sweet wine , he was certainly still fuller of sweet life and had renounced all weariness . <end>
<start> There are even such as tell that then even the ass danced . <end>
<start> For not in vain had the ugliest man it is said given it wine to drink before . <end>
<start> This may be so , or it may be otherwise . <end>
<start> And if in truth the ass did not dance that night , greater and stranger wonders happened , than the dancing of an ass would have been . <end>
<start> In short , as Zarathustra s saying goethe , What matter ! <end>
<start> When this came to pass with the ugliest man , Zarathustra stood there like one drunken . <end>
<start> His look was dimmed , his tongue stammered , his feet staggered . <end>
<start> And who could guess what thoughts then passed over Zarathustra s soul ? <end>
<start> But his spirit apparently retreated and fled before him , and was in far distances , and , as it were , walking like a heavy cloud on a high ridge , as it is written , Between two seas , between what is past and what is to come . <end>
<start> But by and by , while the higher men held him in their arms , he came back somewhat unto himself , and with his hands hindered the throng of the reversing and anxious ones . <end>
<start> But he spake not . <end>
<start> All at once he swiftly turned his head , for he seemed to hear something . <end>
<start> Then he laid his finger on his mouth and said : Come And immediately it grew still and homesite round about . <end>
<start> But from the depth there rose slowly the sound of a bell . <end>
<start> Zarathustra listened unto it , like the higher men . <end>
<start> But then , for a second time , he laid his finger on his mouth and said again : Come come ! <end>
<start> It is nigh unto midnight ! <end>
<start> And his voice had changed . <end>
<start> But not yet did . <end>
<start> he move from the spot . <end>
<start> Then it grew still quieter and more homesite , and everything heartened , including the ass and Zarathustra s animals of honour , the eagle and the serpent and likewise Zarathustra s cave , and the great cool moon , and the night itself . <end>
<start> But Zarathustra , for a third time , laid his hand on his mouth and said : Come ! <end>
<start> Come ! <end>
<start> Come ! <end>
<start> Let us walk now ! <end>
<start> It is the hour ! <end>
<start> Let us walk into the night ! <end>
<start> Ye higher men , it is nigh unto midnight . <end>
<start> Now I will say something into your ears , as that old bell teeth it into mine As familiarly , as terribly , as heartily , as speaker unto me that midnight bell which hath seen more than any man Which hath long ago counted the pulses of your fathers heart beat , and pain . <end>
<start> Alas ! <end>
<start> alas ! <end>
<start> how it sight ! <end>
<start> how it laughed in dream ! <end>
<start> the old , deep , deep midnight ! <end>
<start> Hush ! <end>
<start> Hush ! <end>
<start> Then many things are heard which are not permitted to become audible in day time . <end>
<start> But now , in the cool air , after even all noise of your hearts hath been stilled Now they speak , now they are heard , now they steal into night like over wakeful souls . <end>
<start> Alas ! <end>
<start> alas ! <end>
<start> how midnight sight , how it laughed in dream ! <end>
<start> nearest thou not , how it familiarly , terribly , heartily speaker unto thee old , deep , deep midnight ? <end>
<start> man , lose not sight ! <end>
<start> Woe unto me ! <end>
<start> Whither is time gone ? <end>
<start> Sank I not into deep wells ? <end>
<start> The world sleeper . <end>
<start> Alas ! <end>
<start> alas ! <end>
<start> The dog howlett , the moon shine . <end>
<start> Rather will I die , die than tell you what my thinkers this moment . <end>
<start> Now I have died . <end>
<start> It is gone . <end>
<start> Spider , why spines thou round me ? <end>
<start> Wouldst thou have blood ? <end>
<start> Alas ! <end>
<start> alas ! <end>
<start> The dew fallen , the hour cometh ! <end>
<start> The hour when I feel cool and cold , which asked and asked and asked : Who hath courage enough ? <end>
<start> Who shall be the master of earth ? <end>
<start> Who will say : Thus shall ye flow , ye great and small streams ! <end>
<start> The hour approaches ! <end>
<start> O man , thou higher man , lose not sight ! <end>
<start> This speech is for fine ears , for thine ears . <end>
<start> What saith the deep midnight f am carried away . <end>
<start> My soul dance . <end>
<start> Work of the day ! <end>
<start> Work of the day ! <end>
<start> Who shall be the master of earth ? <end>
<start> The moon is cool , the wind is silent . <end>
<start> Alas ! <end>
<start> alas ! <end>
<start> Have ye hitherto flown high enough ? <end>
<start> Ye danced . <end>
<start> But ye see , a leg is not a wing . <end>
<start> Ye good dancers , now all lust is gone . <end>
<start> Wine became lees , every cup became mellow , the graves stammer . <end>
<start> Ye have not flown high enough . <end>
<start> Now the graves stammer : Redeem the dead ! <end>
<start> Why is it night so long ? <end>
<start> Doth the moon not make us drunken ? <end>
<start> Ye higher men , redeem the graves , awaken the corpses ! <end>
<start> Alas ! <end>
<start> Why digger the worm ? <end>
<start> The hour approaches , approaches . <end>
<start> The bell hummed , even the heart turret , even the wood worm , the heart worm , digger . <end>
<start> Alas ! <end>
<start> alas ! <end>
<start> The world is deep ! <end>
<start> Sweet lyre ! <end>
<start> Sweet lyre ! <end>
<start> I love thy tone , thy drunken tone of toads ! <end>
<start> From what time , from what distance , come thy tones unto me , from a far distance , from the ponds of love ? <end>
<start> Thou old bell , thou sweet lyre ! <end>
<start> Every pain made a gap in thy heart , the pain of the father , the pain of the fathers , the pain of the forefathers . <end>
<start> Thy speech hath become ripe Ripe as a golden autumn and afternoon , as my hermit heart . <end>
<start> Now speaker thou : The world itself hath become ripe , the grape become brown . <end>
<start> Now it wanted to die , to die of happiness . <end>
<start> Ye higher men , do ye not smell it ? <end>
<start> Secretly an odour springett up . <end>
<start> A smell and odour of eternity , a smell blissful as roses , brown , like golden wine , an odour of old happiness ! <end>
<start> An odour of the drunken happiness of , that singer : The world is deep , and deeper than ever day thought it might ! <end>
<start> Leave me ! <end>
<start> Leave me ! <end>
<start> I am too pure for thee ! <end>
<start> Touch me not ! <end>
<start> Hath my world not this moment become perfect ? <end>
<start> My skin is too pure for thy hands . <end>
<start> Leave me , thou stupid , coltish , sultry day ! <end>
<start> Is midnight not brighter ? <end>
<start> The purest shall be the lords of earth the least recognised , the strongest , the midnight souls , which are brighter and deeper than any day . <end>
<start> O day , thou grasped after me ? <end>
<start> Thou gropes for my happiness ? <end>
<start> For thee I am rich , lonely , a treasure pit , a gold chamber ? <end>
<start> O world , thou wanted me ? <end>
<start> Am I of the world for thee ? <end>
<start> Am I spiritual for thee ? <end>
<start> Am I divine for thee ? <end>
<start> But day and world , ye are too bulky . <end>
<start> Have cleverer hands grasp for deeper happiness , for deeper misfortune grasp for any God , grasp not for me ! <end>
<start> strange day , and yet I am no God , no God s hell . <end>
<start> Deep is its woe . <end>
<start> God s woe is deeper , thou strange world ! <end>
<start> Grasp for God s woe , not for me ! <end>
<start> What am I ? <end>
<start> A drunken sweet lyre . <end>
<start> A midnight lyre , a bell toad , understood by no one , but compelled to speak , before deaf ones , ye higher men ! <end>
<start> For ye understand me not ! <end>
<start> Gone ! <end>
<start> Gone ! <end>
<start> Oh , youth ! <end>
<start> Oh , noon ! <end>
<start> Oh , afternoon ! <end>
<start> Now evening and night and midnight have come . <end>
<start> The dog howlett , the wind . <end>
<start> Is the wind not a dog ? <end>
<start> It whimpered , market , howlett . <end>
<start> Alas ! <end>
<start> alas ! <end>
<start> How midnight sight ! <end>
<start> How it laughed , how it rattled and paneth , midnight ! <end>
<start> How it now speaker soberly , this drunken poet ! <end>
<start> Did it overdrive its drunkenness ? <end>
<start> Did it become over wakeful ? <end>
<start> Doth it ruminate ? <end>
<start> It ruminated upon its woe in dream , the old deep midnight . <end>
<start> And it still more ruminated upon its delight . <end>
<start> For delight , if woe be deep , be deep already Deeper is still than woe delight . <end>
<start> Thou vine plant ! <end>
<start> Why praises thou me ? <end>
<start> Did I not cut thee ? <end>
<start> I am cruel , thou bleeds . <end>
<start> What meant thy praise of my drunken cruelty ? <end>
<start> Whatever hath become perfect , all that is ripe , wanted to die ! <end>
<start> thou safest . <end>
<start> Be the vine knife blessed , blessed ! <end>
<start> But all that is unripe , wanted to live ! <end>
<start> Alas ! <end>
<start> Saith woe : Pass , go ! <end>
<start> Away , thou woe ! <end>
<start> But everything that suffered wanted to live in order to become ripe and gay and longing , Longing for what is more distant , higher , brighter . <end>
<start> I want heirs , thus saith everything that suffered , I want children , I want not myself . <end>
<start> But delight wanted not heirs , not children . <end>
<start> Delight wanted itself , wanted eternity , wanted recurrence , wanted everything to be eternally equal unto itself . <end>
<start> Saith woe : Break , bleed , heart ! <end>
<start> Walk , leg ! <end>
<start> Wing , fly ! <end>
<start> Up ! <end>
<start> Upward ! <end>
<start> Pain ! <end>
<start> Up ! <end>
<start> Up ! <end>
<start> Oh , mine old heart ! <end>
<start> Saith woe : Pass , go Ye higher men , what appeared unto you ? <end>
<start> Am I a prophet ? <end>
<start> A dreamer ? <end>
<start> A drunken one ? <end>
<start> An interpreter of dreams ? <end>
<start> A midnight bell ? <end>
<start> A drop of dew ? <end>
<start> A smell and odour of eternity ? <end>
<start> Hear ye not ? <end>
<start> Smell ye not ? <end>
<start> This moment hath my world become perfect . <end>
<start> Midnight is noon also ! <end>
<start> Pain is a delight also ! <end>
<start> Curse is a blessing also . <end>
<start> Night is a sun also . <end>
<start> Go off ! <end>
<start> Otherwise ye will learn : A wise man is a fool also . <end>
<start> Said ye ever Yea unto one delight ? <end>
<start> O friends , if ye did , ye have also said Yea unto all woe . <end>
<start> All things are chained , knotted , in love . <end>
<start> If ye ever wanted to have one time twice , if ye ever said : Thou pleases me , O happiness , O instant , O moment ! <end>
<start> ye wished everything to come back ! <end>
<start> Everything anew , everything eternal , everything chained , knotted , in love . <end>
<start> Oh ! <end>
<start> thus ye loved the world ! <end>
<start> Ye eternal ones , ye love it eternally and for all time . <end>
<start> And even unto woe ye say : Pass , go , but return ! <end>
<start> For eternity s sought by all delight ! <end>
<start> Eternity of all things is sought by all delight . <end>
<start> Honey , lees , drunken midnight , graves , comfort of tears at graves , gilded evening red , are sought by it . <end>
<start> What is not sought by delight ! <end>
<start> It is thirties , hearties , hungrier , more dreadful , more familiar than all woe . <end>
<start> It seemeth itself , it birth into itself . <end>
<start> The will of the ring struggle in it . <end>
<start> It seemeth love it seemeth hatred it is over rich it giveth it thrower away it begged , that one may take it it thanked him who taketh it would fain be hated . <end>
<start> So rich is delight , that it thirtieth for me , for hell , for hatred , for shame , for the cripple , for world , for this world ! <end>
<start> Oh , ye know it ! <end>
<start> Ye higher men , for yourselves it longer , delight , the unruly , blissful one , for your woe , ye ill constituted ! <end>
<start> For failures all eternal delight longer ! <end>
<start> For all delight seemeth itself . <end>
<start> Therefore it also seemeth woe ! <end>
<start> Oh , happiness ! <end>
<start> Oh , pain ! <end>
<start> Oh , break , heart ! <end>
<start> Ye higher men , learn that eternity is sought by delight . <end>
<start> Eternity of all things is sought by delight , eternity deep by all delight ! <end>
<start> Have ye now learnt my song ? <end>
<start> Guessed ye what it seemeth ? <end>
<start> Up ! <end>
<start> Up ! <end>
<start> Ye higher men , sing now my roundly ! <end>
<start> Sing now yourselves the song whose name is Once more , whose sense is For all eternity ! <end>
<start> Sing , ye higher men , Zarathustra s roundly ! <end>
<start> What saith the deep midnight ? <end>
<start> lay in sleep , in sleep The world is deep , Deep is its woe , Saith woe : Pass , go ! <end>
<start> Eternity deep by all delight ! <end>
<start> THE SIGN But the morning after that night , Zarathustra jumped up from his couch , girded his loins , and stepped out of his cave , glowing and strong , like a morning sun coming from dark mountains . <end>
<start> Thou great star he said , as he had said once , thou deep eye of happiness , what would be all thy happiness , if thou hadst not those for whom thou shines ! <end>
<start> And if they would remain in their chambers , while thou art awake and comes and gives and distributes , how angry would thy proud shame be at that ! <end>
<start> Up ! <end>
<start> They sleep still , these higher men , whilst am awake . <end>
<start> They are not my proper companions ! <end>
<start> Not for them wait I here in my mountains . <end>
<start> Unto my work will I go , unto my day . <end>
<start> But they understand not what are the signs of my morning . <end>
<start> My step is for them not a call that awake them from sleep ! <end>
<start> still at my drunken songs . <end>
<start> The ear that for me , the obeying ear , is lacking in their limbs . <end>
<start> This had Zarathustra said unto his heart , when the sun rose . <end>
<start> Then he asking looked upward , for he heard above him the sharp cry of his eagle . <end>
<start> Up ! <end>
<start> he shouted upward , thus it pleaseth me and is due unto me . <end>
<start> Mine animals are awake , for I am awake . <end>
<start> Mine eagle is awake and , like me , honoured the sun . <end>
<start> With an eagle s claws he grasped for the new light . <end>
<start> Ye are my proper animals . <end>
<start> I love you . <end>
<start> Thus spake Zarathustra . <end>
<start> Then it came to pass that he heard of a sudden that he was surrounded by numberless birds that swarmed and fluttered . <end>
<start> But the whizzing of so many wings , and the thronging round his head were so great that he shut his eyes . <end>
<start> And , verily , like a cloud something fell upon him , like a cloud of arrows discharged over a new enemy . <end>
<start> But , behold , here it was a cloud of love , and it hovered over a new friend . <end>
<start> What happened unto me ? <end>
<start> Zarathustra thought in his astonished heart , and slowly sat down on the big stone which lay beside the exit of his cave . <end>
<start> But while he grasped with his hands round himself , and above himself , and below himself , and kept back the tender birds , behold , something still stranger happened unto him . <end>
<start> He unawares laid hold of dense warm shaggy hair . <end>
<start> At the same time a roaring was heard before him , a gentle , long roaring of a lion . <end>
<start> The sign cometh , said Zarathustra , and his heart changed . <end>
<start> And , in truth , when it grew light before him , there lay a yellow powerful animal at his feet , and clung with its head at his knees , and would not leave him , and did thus out of love , and did as a dog doth when he finder his old master again . <end>
<start> But the doves with their love were no less eager than the lion . <end>
<start> And every time when a dove flew quickly across the nose of the lion , the lion shook its head and wondered and laughed . <end>
<start> Whilst all this went on , Zarathustra said but one thing : My children are nigh , my children . <end>
<start> Then he became quite mute . <end>
<start> But his heart was loosened , and from his eyes tears dropped and fell upon his hands . <end>
<start> And he no more took notice of any thing and sat there unmoved , and without keeping the animals back any more . <end>
<start> Then the doves flew to and fro and sat down on his shoulder , and fondled his white hair , and wearied not with tenderness and rejoicing . <end>
<start> But the strong lion always licked the tears which fell down on Zarathustra s hands , and roared and hummed shyly . <end>
<start> Thus did these animals . <end>
<start> This all took a long time or a short time . <end>
<start> For , properly speaking , for such things there is no time on earth . <end>
<start> But in the meantime the higher men had awakened in Zarathustra s cave and arranged them selves into a procession in order to go to meet Zarathustra and to offer him their morning greeting . <end>
<start> For they had found , when they awoke , that he no more dwelt among them . <end>
<start> But when they came unto the door of the cave , and the sound of their steps went before them , the lion , terribly startled , turned all at once away from Zarathustra , and leaped , wildly roaring , towards the cave . <end>
<start> But the higher men , when they heard him roar , all cried out as with one mouth , and fled back and vanished in a moment . <end>
<start> But Zarathustra himself , stunned and strange , rose from his seat , looked round , stood there astonished , asked his heart , remembered , and was alone . <end>
<start> What heard I ? <end>
<start> he at last said slowly . <end>
<start> What happened unto me this moment ? <end>
<start> And immediately his memory came back , and with one look he understood all that had happened between yesterday and to day . <end>
<start> Here is the stone , he said , and stroked his beard . <end>
<start> On it sat lester morning . <end>
<start> And here the fortune teller stepped unto me and here for the first time I heard the cry I heard this moment , the great cry for help . <end>
<start> O ye higher men , of your need it was that lester morning that old fortune teller told me his tale . <end>
<start> Unto your need he tried to seduce me and tempt me . <end>
<start> O Zarathustra , he said unto me , I come to seduce thee unto thy last sin . <end>
<start> Unto my last sin ? <end>
<start> cried Zarathustra , and angrily laughed at his own word . <end>
<start> What hath been reserved for me as my last sin ? <end>
<start> And once more Zarathustra sank into himself and again sat down on the great stone and meditated . <end>
<start> Suddenly he jumped up . <end>
<start> Pity ! <end>
<start> Pity for the higher man ! <end>
<start> he cried out , and his face turned into brass . <end>
<start> Up ! <end>
<start> That hath had its time ! <end>
<start> My woe and my pity , what matter ? <end>
<start> Do I seek for happiness ? <end>
<start> I seek for my work ! <end>
<start> Up ! <end>
<start> the lion hath come . <end>
<start> My children are nigh . <end>
<start> Zarathustra hath ripened . <end>
<start> Mine hour hath come ! <end>
<start> This is my morning . <end>
<start> My day beginners ! <end>
<start> Come up , then , come up , thou great noon ! <end>
<start> Thus spake Zarathustra , and left his cave , glowing and strong , like a morning sun which cometh from dark mountains . <end>
<start> THE END <end>
