<unchecked> <start> PREFACE I relieve myself a little . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is not solely out of sheer wickedness that I praise Bizet at the expense of Wagner in this work . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In the midst of much pleasantry , I bring forward a case which is serious enough . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It was my fate to turn the back on Wagner to be fond of aught afterwards was a triumph . <end>
<unchecked> <start> No one , perhaps , had been more dangerously entangled in magnetism , no one has defended himself harder against it , no one has been more glad to get rid of it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A long history ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Is there a word wanted for it ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> If I were a moralist , who knows how I should designate it ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Perhaps . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But the philosopher never loves mora lists . <end>
<unchecked> <start> neither does he love fancy words . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What does a philosopher firstly and lastly require of himself ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> To overcome his age in himself , to become timeless . <end>
<unchecked> <start> With what , then , has he to wage the hardest strife ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> With the characteristics in which he is just the child of his age . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Well ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> I am the child of this age , just like Wagner , e . <end>
<unchecked> <start> a decadent I am , however , conscious of it I defended myself against it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> My philosophic spirit defended itself against it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The problem of decadence is , in fact , that which has occupied me most profoundly I have had reasons for it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Good and Evil is only a variety of that problem . <end>
<unchecked> <start> When one has learned to discern the symptoms of decline , one also understands morality , one understands what conceals itself under its holiest names and valuation formula namely , impoverished life , desire for the end , great lassitude . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Morality mega times life . <end>
<unchecked> <start> For such a task I required some self-discipline : I had to engage in combat against whatever was morbid in me , including Wagner , including chosen hauer , including all modern humanity . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A pro found estrangement , coolness , and sobriety with ref hence to everything temporary or opportune and as my highest wish , the eye of Zarathustra , an eye , which , exalted to an immense height , surveys the whole phenomenon of man , looks down on it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> To attain such an object what sacrifice would not be appropriate ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> What self overcoming ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> What self-denying ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> My most important experience was a convalescence Wagner belongs only to my maladies . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Not that I would wish to be ungrateful to this malady . <end>
<unchecked> <start> If in this work I maintain the proposition that Wagner is hurtful , I want none the less to maintain to whom , in spite of it all , Wagner is india enable to the philosopher . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In other departments people may perhaps get along without Wagner the philosopher , however , is not free to dispense with him . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The philosopher has to be the bad conscience of his time for that purpose he must possess its best know ledge . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But where would he find a better initiated guide for the labyrinth of modern soul , a more el quest psychological expert than Wagner ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Modernism speaks its most familiar language in Wagner : it con cells neither its good nor its evil , it has lost all its sense of shame . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And reverse : when one has formed a clear notion about what is good and evil in Wagner , one has almost determined the value of modernism . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I understand perfectly , when a musician says now , I hate Wagner , but I no longer stand any other music . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I should however also understand a philosopher who declared , Wagner summarises modernism . <end>
<unchecked> <start> There is no help for it we must first be wagnerian . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I heard yesterday will you believe it ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> the masterpiece of Bizet for the twentieth time . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I again held out with meek devotion , I again succeeded in not running away . <end>
<unchecked> <start> This victory over my impatience surprises me . <end>
<unchecked> <start> How such a work perfects one ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> One becomes a masterpiece one s self by its influence . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And really , I have appeared to myself , every time I have heard Carmen , to be more of a philosopher , a better philosopher than at other times : I have sitting : the first stage of holiness ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> May I ven sure to say that Bizet s orchestra music is almost the sole orchestration I yet endure ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> That other orchestra music which is all the rage at present , the Wagnerian orchestration , at once brutal , artificial , and innocent thereby speaking to the three senses of modern soul at the same time , ho v detrimental to me is that Wagnerian orchestration ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> I call it the morocco . <end>
<unchecked> <start> An unpleasant sweat breaks out on me . <end>
<unchecked> <start> My good time is at an end . <end>
<unchecked> <start> This music seems to me to be perfect . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It ap preaches lightly , nimbly , and with courtesy . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is ami able , it does not produce sweat . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What is good is easy everything divine runs with light feet : the first proposition of my aesthetics . <end>
<unchecked> <start> This music is wicked , subtle , and fatalistic it remains popular at the same time , it has the subtlety of a race , not of an india visual . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is rich . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is precise . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It builds , it organises , it completes it is thus the antithesis to the polyps in music , infinite melody . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Have more painful , tragic accents ever been heard on the stage ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> And how are they obtained ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Without grimace ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Without counterfeit coinage ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Without the imposture of the grand style ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Finally , this music takes the auditor for an intelligent being , even for a musician here also Bizet is the contrast to Wagner , who , whatever else he was , was certainly the most un courteous genius in the world . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Wagner takes us just as if , he says a thing again and again until one despairs , until one believes it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And once more , I become a better man when this Bizet exhorts me . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Also a better musician , a better auditor . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Is it at all possible to listen better ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> I bury my ears under this music , I hear the very reason of it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I seem to assist at its production I tremble before dangers which accompany any hazardous enterprise , I am enraptured by strokes of good fortune of which Bizet is innocent . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And , curiously enough , I don t think of it after all , or I don t know how much I think of it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> For quite other thoughts run through my mind at the time . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Has it been noticed that music makes the spirit free f that it gives wings to thought ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> that one becomes so much more a philosopher , the more one becomes a musician ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> The grey heaven of abstraction thrilled , as it were , by lightnings the light strong enough for all the filigree of things the great problems ready to be grasped the universe surveyed as from a mountain summit . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I have just defined philosophical pathos . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And answers fall into my lap unexpectedly a little hail shower of ice and wisdom , of solved problems . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Where am I ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Bizet makes me productive . <end>
<unchecked> <start> All that is good makes me productive . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I have no other grate tube , nor have I any other proof of what is good . <end>
<unchecked> <start> This work saves also Wagner is not the only Saviour . <end>
<unchecked> <start> With Bizet s work one takes leave of the humid north , and all the steam of the Wagnerian ideal . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Even the dramatic action saves us there from . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It has borrowed from merited the logic in passion , the shortest route , stern necessity . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It possesses , above all , what belongs to the warm cli mate , the dry ness of the air , its . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Here , in all respects , the climate is altered . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Here a dif fervent sensuality expresses itself , a different sense ability , a different gaiety . <end>
<unchecked> <start> This music is gay but it has not a French or a German gaiety . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Its gaiety is African destiny hangs over it , its happiness is short , sudden , and without forgiveness . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I envy Bizet for having had the courage for this sensibility , which did not hitherto find expression in the cultured music of Europe this more southern , more tawny , more scorched sensibility . <end>
<unchecked> <start> How the yellow afternoons of its happiness benefit us ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> We contemplate the out look : did we ever see the sea smoother ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> And how the Moorish dance appeals to us ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> How even our instability learns for once to be satiated with its lascivious melancholy ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Finally , love , love translated again into nature Not the love of a cultured maiden ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> No Senta sentimentality ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> But love as fate , as fatality , cynical , innocent , cruel , and thus true to nature ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Love , which in its expedients is the war of the sexes , and in its basis their mortal hatred . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I know of no case where tragic humour , which forms the essence of love , has expressed itself so strenuously , has formulated itself so terribly , as in the last cry of Don Jose , with which the work con clues : yes ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> myself have killed her Senta is one of Wagner s female personages . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Such a conception of love the only one which is worthy of a philosopher is rare it distinguishes a work of art among thousands of others . <end>
<unchecked> <start> For , on an average , artists do like all the world , or worse even they misunderstand love . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Wagner also has mis understood it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> People imagine they are unselfish in love because they seek the advantage of another being , often in opposition to their own advantage . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But for so doing they want to possess the other being . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Even God himself is no exception to this rule . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He is far from thinking , What need you trouble about it , if I love you ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> he becomes a terror , if he is not loved in return . <end>
<unchecked> <start> L Amour with this word one gains one s case with gods and men est de tits les sentiments le plus egoist , et , par con sequent , lorsch il cst bless e , le coins generous B . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Constant . <end>
<unchecked> <start> You already see how much this music improves me ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> fact la musique : I have reasons for using this formula Beyond Good and Evil , Nr . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The return to nature , to health , to gaiety , to youth , and to virtue ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> And yet I was one of the most corrupt of the wagnerian . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I was capable of taking Wagner seriously . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Ah , this old magician ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> to what extent has he imposed upon us ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> The first thing his art furnishes is a magnifying glass . <end>
<unchecked> <start> weir THE CASE OF WAGNER look into it , we don t trust our eyes everything be comes great , even Wagner becomes great . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What a wise rattlesnake ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> All his life he has rattled before us about devotion , about loyalty , about purity with a panegyric on chastity , he withdrew from the corrupt world ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> And we have believed him . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But you do not listen to me ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> You prefer even the problem of Wagner to that of Bizet ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> I don t undervalue it myself , it has its charm . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The problem of salvation is even a venerable problem . <end>
<unchecked> <start> There is nothing which Wagner has meditated on more pro fondly than salvation his opera is the opera of sal nation . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Someone always wants to be saved in Wagner s works at one time it is some little man , at another time it is some little woman that is his problem . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And with what opulence he varies his leading motive ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> What rare , what profound sallies ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Who was it but Wagner taught us that innocence has a preference for saving interesting sinners the case in Tannhduser ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Or that even the Wandering Jew will be saved , will become settled , if he marries the case in the Flying Dutchman ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Or that corrupt old women prefer to be saved by chaste youths the case of sundry in Parsifal ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Or that young hysterics like best to be saved by their doctor the case in Lohengrin ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Or that handsome girls like best to be saved by a cavalier who is a Wagnerian the case in the Master singers ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Or that even married womenTHE CASE OF WAGNER I I are willingly saved by a cavalier the case of Isolde ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Or that the old God , after he has compromised himself morally in every respect , is finally saved by a freethinkers and immorality the case in the nibbling s Ring ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Admire especially this last profundity ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Do you understand it ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> I take good care not to understand it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That other lessons also may be derived from these w r works , I would rather prove than deny . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That one can be brought to despair by a Wagnerian ballet and to virtue once more the case of Tannhduser That the worst consequences may result if one does not go to bed at the right time once more the case of Lohengrin . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That one should never know too exactly whom one marries for the third time the case of Lohengrin , Tristan and Isolde extols the perfect husband , who on a certain occasion has only one question in his mouth : But why have you not told me that sooner ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Nothing was simpler than that ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Answer : In truth : cannon tell it gt Remains for aye unanswered . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Lohengrin contains a solemn proscription of invest nation and questioning . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Wagner , accordingly , ad locates the Christian doctrine , Thou shalt believe , and must believe . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is an offence against the highest and holiest to be scientific . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The Flying Dutchman preaches the sublime doctrine that woman makes even the most vagabond person settle down , or , in Wagnerian language , saves him . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Here we take the liberty to ask a question . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Granted that it is true , would it at the same time be desirable ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> What becomes of the Wandering Jew , adored and settled down by a woman ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> He simply ceases to be the eternal wanderer , he marries , and is of no more interest to us . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Trans later into actuality : the danger of artists , of geniuses for these are the Wandering Jews lies in woman : adoring women are their ruin . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Hardly anyone has sufficient character to resist being cor erupted being saved when he finds himself treated as a god : he forthwith condescend to woman . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Man is cowardly before all that is eternally feminine : women know it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In many cases of feminine love perhaps precisely in the most celebrated cases , love is only a more refined parasitism , a nestling in a strange soul , sometimes even in a strange body Ah ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> at what expense always to the host ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Goethe s fate in moral acid , old maidens Ger many is known . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He was always a scandal to the Germans he has had honest admirers only among recesses . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Schiller , noble Schiller , who blustered round their ears w r ith high flown phrases , he was according to their taste . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Why did they reproach Goethe ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> For the Mountain of Venus , and because he had composed Venetian epigrams . <end>
<unchecked> <start> lostock had already preached to him on morals there was a time when Herder had a preference for the word Priapus , when speaking of Goethe . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Even Wilhelm Meister was only regarded as a symptom of decadence , of going to the dogs in morals . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The menagerie of tame cattle which it exhibits , and the meanness of the hero , exasperated Xiebuhr , for example , who finally breaks out into a lamentation which Biterolf might have chanted : Hardly anything can produce a more painful impression than a great mind despairing itself of its wings , and seeking its virtuosity in something far lower , while it renounces the higher . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The cultured maiden was however especially roused : all the little courts every sort of warburg in Germanycrossed themselves before Goethe , before the unclean spirit in Goethe . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Wagner has set this history to music . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He saves Goethe , that goes without saying , but he does it in such a way that he adroitly takes the part of the cultured maiden at the same time . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Goethe is saved a prayer saves him , a cultured maiden draws him . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What Goethe would have thought of Wagner ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Goethe once proposed to himself the question , What is the danger which hovers over all romanticism : the fate of the romanticism ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> His answer was , Suffocation by chewing moral and religious absurdities over again . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In fewer words : Parsifal The philosopher adds an epilogue to that answer . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Holiness the last of the higher values perhaps still seen by and woman , the horizon of the ideal for all who are naturally myopic . <end>
<unchecked> <start> For philosophers , however , it is like every other horizon , a mere mishap pretension , a sort of door closing of the region where their world only commences their danger , their ideal , their desirability . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Expressed more politely : la philosophic ne suit pas au grand sombre . <end>
<unchecked> <start> II his fact la sainteny . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I further recount the story of the nibbling s Ring . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It belongs to this place . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is also a story of salvation , only , this time , it is Wagner himself who is saved . <end>
<unchecked> <start> For the half of his life , Wagner has believed in revolution , as none but a Frenchman has ever believed in it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He sought for it in the Runic cha rafters of myths , he believed that he found in Sieg fried the typical revolutionise . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Whence comes all the evil in the world ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Wagner asked himself . <end>
<unchecked> <start> From old conventions he answered , like every revolutionary ideologist . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That means from customs , laws , morals , and institutions , from all that the old world , old society rest on . <end>
<unchecked> <start> How does one get rid of the evil in the world ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> How does one do away with old society ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Only by declaring war against conventions traditional usage and morality . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That is what Sieg fried does . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He commences early with it , very early : his procreation already is a declaration of war against morality he comes into the world through adultery and incest . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is not the legend , but Wagner who is the inventor of this radical trait on this point he has corrected the legend . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Siegfried continues as he commenced : he follows only the first impulse , he casts aside all tradition , all reverence , all fear . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Whatever displeased him , he stabs down . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He runs irreverently to the attack on the old Deities . <end>
<unchecked> <start> His principal undertaking , however , is for the purpose of emancipating woman saving brunhild . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Sieg fried and brunhild the sacrament of free love the dawn of the golden age the twilight of the Gods of old morality ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> evil is done away with . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Wagner s vessel ran merrily on this course for a long time . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Here , undoubtedly , Wagner sought his highest goal . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What happened ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> A misfortune . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The vessel went on a reef Wagner was run aground . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The reef was Schopenhauer s philosophy Wagner was run aground on a contrary view of things . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What had he set to music ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Optimism . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Wagner was ashamed . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In addition , it was an optimism for which chosen hauer had formed a malicious epithet infamous optimism . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He was once more ashamed . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He thought long over it his situation seemed desperate . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A way out of the difficulty finally dawned on his mind . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The reef on which he was wrecked how would it be if he interpreted it as the goal , the ultimate purpose , the real meaning of his voyage ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> To be wrecked here that was a goal also . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Bene navigate cum fed . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And he translated the nibbling s Ring into schopenhauerian . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Everything goes wrong , everything goes to ruin , the new world is as bad as the old . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Nothingness , the Indian Circe , makes a sign . <end>
<unchecked> <start> brunhild , who according to the earlier design had to take leave with a song in honour of free love , placing the world in anticipation of a Socialistic Utopia in which all will be well , has now something else to do . <end>
<unchecked> <start> She has first to study Schopenhauer she has to put into verse the fourth book of the World as Will and Representation . <end>
<unchecked> <start> manner was saved . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In all seriousness , that was salvation . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The service for which Wagner is indebted to Schopenhauer is immense . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It was only the philo soper of decadence who enabled the artist of dec. <end>
<unchecked> <start> hence to discover himself . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The artist of decadence that is the word . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And it is here that my seriousness commences . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I am not at all inclined to be a quiet spectator , when this decadent ruins our health and music along with it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Is Wagner a man at all ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Is he not rather a disease ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Everything he touches he makes morbid he has made music morbid . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A typical decadent , who feels himself necessary with his corrupt taste , who claims that it is a higher taste , who knows how to make his depravity be regarded as a law , as a progress , as fulfilment . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And nobody defends himself . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Wagner s power of seduction becomes prodigious , the smoke of incense steams around him , the misunderstanding about him calls itself Gospel it is by no means the poor in spirit exclusively whom he has convinced . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I should like to open the windows a little . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Air ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> More air ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> It does not surprise me that people deceive them selves about Wagner in Germany . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The contrary would surprise me . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The Germans have created for themselves a Wagner whom they can worship they were never psychologists , they are grateful by mis understanding . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But that people also deceive them selves about Wagner in Paris ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> where people are almost nothing else but psychologists . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And in St . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Petersburg ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> where things are still divined which are not divined even in Paris . <end>
<unchecked> <start> How intimately related to the entire European decadence must Wagner be , when he is not recognised by it as a decadent . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He belongs to it : he is its Protagonist , its greatest name . <end>
<unchecked> <start> People honour themselves by exalting him to the skies . <end>
<unchecked> <start> For it is already a sign of decadence that no one defends himself against Wagner . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Instinct is weakened . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What should be shunned attracts people . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What drives still faster into the abyss is put to the lips . <end>
<unchecked> <start> You want an example ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> One need only observe the regime which the anaemic , the gout , and the diabetic prescribe for themselves . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Definition of the vegetarian : a being who needs a strengthening diet . <end>
<unchecked> <start> To recognise what is hurtful , as hurtful , to be able to deny one s self that is hurtful , is a sign of youth and vitality . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The exhausted is alluded by what is hurtful the vegetarian by his pot herbs . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Disease itself may be a stimulus to life : only , a person must be sound enough for such a stimulus ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Wagner increases exhaustion it is on that account that he allure the weak and exhausted . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Oh , the rattlesnake joy of the old master , when he always saw just the little children come to him ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> I give prominence to this point of view : Wagner s art is morbid . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The problems which he brings upon the stage nothing but problems of hysterics , the conclusiveness of his emotion , his over excited sense ability , his taste , which always asked for stronger stimulants , his instability , which he disguised as pain miles , and , not least , the choice of his heroes and heroines , regarded as physiological types a gallery of morbid individuals ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> altogether these symptoms represent a picture of disease about which there can be no mistake . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Wagner est unc nervosa . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Nothing is perhaps better known at present , at any rate nothing is studied more than the Protean character of degeneracy , which here crystallises as art and artist . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Our physicians and physiologists have in WagnerTHE CASE OF WAGNER ig their most interesting case , at least a very complete case . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Just because nothing is more modern than this entire , this decrepitude and over excitability of the nervous mechanism , Wagner is the modern artist par excellence , the Cagliostro of modernism . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In his art there is mixed , in the most seductive manner , the things at present most necessary for everybody the three great stimulants of the exhausted , brutality , artifice , and innocence idiocy . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Wagner is a great ruin for music . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He has divined in music the expedient for exciting fatigued nerves he has thus made music morbid . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He pos senses no small inventive ability in the art of pricking up once more the most exhausted , and calling back to life those who are half dead . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He is the master of hypnotic passes , he upsets , like the bulls , the very strongest . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The success of Wagner his success on the nerves , and consequently on women has made all the ambitious musical world disciples of his magical art . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And not the ambitious only , the shrewd also . <end>
<unchecked> <start> At present money is only made by morbid music , our great theatres live by Wagner . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I again allow myself a little gaiety . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I suppose the case that the Success of Wagner became embodied , took form , and that , disguised as a philanthropic musical savant , it mixed among young artists . <end>
<unchecked> <start> How do you think it would express itself under the cir substances ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> My friends , it would say , let us have five words among ourselves . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is easier to make bad music than good music . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What , if , apart from that , it were also more advantageous ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> more effective , more per survive , more inspiring , more sure ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> more Wagnerian ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Pulchruvi est . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Bad enough ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> We understand Latin , we perhaps also understand our advantage . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The beautiful has its thorns we are aware of that . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What is the good , then , of beauty ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Why not rather the grand , the sublime , the gigantic , that which moves the masses ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> And once more : it is easier to be gigantic than to be beautiful we are aware of that . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We know the masses , we know the theatre . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The best that sit in it , German youths , horned siegfried and other wagnerian , require the sublime , the pro found , the overpowering . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Thus much we can ac comprise . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And the others that sit in the theatre the culture cretins , the little biases , the eternally feminine , the good digesters , in short the people similarly require the sublime , the profound , and the overpowering . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Those have all one kind of logic . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He who upsets us is strong he who raises us is divine he who makes us imaginative is profound . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let us decide , Messrs , the musicians : let us upset them , let us raise them , let us make them imaginative . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Thus much we can accomplish . <end>
<unchecked> <start> As regards the making imaginative , it is here that our conception of style has its starting point . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Above all , there must be no thought ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Nothing is more com promising than a thought ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> But the state of mind which precedes thought , the travail of yet unborn thoughts , the promise of future thoughts , the world as it w r as before God created it a recrudescence of chaos . <end>
<unchecked> <start> chaos makes imaginative . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In the language of the master : infinity , but without melody . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In the second place , as concerns the upsetting , it already belongs in part to physiology . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let us study first of all the instruments . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Some of them persuade even the bo vets they open the doors , as Handel says , others charm the spinal marrow . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The colour of sound is decisive here what resounds is almost indifferent . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let us refine on this point ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> What is the use of wasting ourselves on other matters ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let us be characteristic in sound , even to foolishness ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is attributed to our genius when we give much to con lecture in our sounds ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let us irritate the nerves , let us strike them dead , let us make use of lightning and thunder , that upsets . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Above all , however , passion upsets . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let there be no misunderstanding among us with regard to passion . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Nothing is less expensive than passion . <end>
<unchecked> <start> One can dispense with all the virtues of counterpoint , one need not have learned anything , one can always use passion . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Beauty is difficult : let us guard ourselves against beauty ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> And melody still more ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let us disparage , my friends , let us disparage , if we are serious about the ideal , let us disparage melody ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Nothing is more dangerous than a fine melody ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Nothing more certainly ruins the taste . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We are lost , my friends , if fine melodies are again loved ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Principle : Melody is immoral . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Proof : Palestrina . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Application : Parsifal . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The want of melody even sanctified . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And this is the definition of passion . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Passion or the gymnastics of the loathsome on the rope of harmonics . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let us dare , my friends , to be loath some ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Wagner has dared it ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let us splash before us , undismayed , the mire of the most odious harmonies ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let us not spare our hands ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is thus only that we become natural . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A last counsel ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Perhaps it embraces all in one : Let us be idealists ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> If this is not the most expedient thing we can do , it is at least the wisest . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In order to raise men , we ourselves must be exalted . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let us walk above the clouds , let us harangue the infinite , let us surround ourselves with grand symbols ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> pursuit ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Bumbuui ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> there is no better counsel . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let fullness of heart be our argument let fine feeling be our advocate . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Virtue still wins the case against counterpoint . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He who makes us better how could it be that he was not good himself ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> such has always been the conclusion of mankind . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let us therefore make mankind better ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> one thereby becomes good one thereby becomes classic even : Schiller became a classic . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Seeking after ignoble sense excitement , after so called beauty , has generated the Italians let us remain German ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Even Mozart s relation to music Wagner has told us by way of consolation ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> was frivolous after all . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let us never admit that music serves for recreation , that it cheers up , that it fur wishes enjoyment . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let us never furnish enjoyment ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> we are lost , if people again think of art as hedonism tic . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That belongs to the bad eighteenth century . <end>
<unchecked> <start> On the other hand , nothing might be more advisable we say it apart than a dose of hypocrisy , sit venial verb . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That gives dignity . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And let us choose the hour when it is suitable to look black , to sigh publicly , to sigh in a Christian manner , to exhibit large Christian sympathy . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Man is depraved : who will save him ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> What will save hiv ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let us not answer . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let us be careful . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let us struggle against our ambition , which would like to found religions . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But nobody must venture to doubt that we save him , that our music alone brings salvation . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Wagner s Essay , Religion and Art . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Enough ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Enough ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> I fear sinister reality will have been too plainly recognised under my cheerful lines the picture of a decline in art , of a decline also in the artists . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The latter , a decline of character , would perhaps receive a proviso expression with this formula : the musician is now becoming a , his art is developing more and more into a talent for lying . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I shall have an opportunity in a chapter of my principal work , which bears the title , A Physiology of Art of showing in detail how this total transformation of art into stage playing is just as definite an expression of physiological defence ration more exactly , a form of hysterics as any of the corruptions and weaknesses of the art inaugurated by Wagner for example , the restlessness of its optics , which necessitates continual changing of posture before it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> One understands nothing of Wagner so long as one only sees in him a sport of nature , a caprice , a whim , or an accident . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He was no defect time , abortive , or contradictory , genius as has oc occasionally been said . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Wagner was something complete , a typical decadent , in whom all free will was lacking , all whose characteristics were determined by necessity . <end>
<unchecked> <start> If anything is interesting in Wagner , it is the logic with which a physiological trouble , as practice and procedure , as innovation in principles and crisis in taste , advances step by step , from conclusion to con cousin . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I confine myself this time solely to the question of style . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What is the characteristic of all literary decadence It is that the life no longer resides in the whole . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The word gets the upper hand and jumps out of the sentence , the sentence stretches too far and obscures the meaning of the page , the page acquires life at the expense of the whole the whole is no longer a whole . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But that is the simile for every style of decadence : always anarchy of the atoms , disaggregation of will , in the language of morality , liberty of the individual , widened to a political theory , equal rights for all . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Life , equal vitality , vibration and exuberance of life pushed back into the most minute structures , the others poor in life . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Everywhere paralysis , distress , and torpor , or hostility and chaos , always becoming more striking , as one ascends to ever higher forms of organisation . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The whole has ceased to live altogether it is composite , summed up , artificial , an unnatural product . <end>
<unchecked> <start> There is hallucination at the commencement in Wagner not of tones , but of gestures for these he seeks the appropriate semiotic tones . <end>
<unchecked> <start> If you want to admire him , see him at work here : how he separates , how he arrives at little unities , how he animates them , inflates them , and renders them visible . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But by so doing his power exhausts itself : the rest is worth nothing . <end>
<unchecked> <start> How pitiable , how confused , how laid is his mode of developing , his attempt to pierce at least into one another , things which have not grown out of one another ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> His manner here reminds one of the francs dc G on court , whose style approaches Wagner s in other respects also . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A sort of pity is aroused for so much trouble . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That Wagner has masked under the guise of a principle his incapacity for creating organically , that he asserts a dramatic style where we assert merely his incapacity for any style , corresponds to an audacious habit which has accompanied Wagner all his life : he posits a principle where he lacks a faculty very different in this respect , let us say in passing , from old Kant , who loved another kind of audacity : whenever he lacked a pain simple , he posited a faculty in human beings . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Once more let it be said that Wagner is only worthy of admiration and love in the invention of , in the elaboration of details here we have every right to proclaim him as a master of the first rank , as our greatest miniaturist in music , who compresses into the smallest space an infinite of meaning and sweetness . <end>
<unchecked> <start> His wealth of colours , of demi tints , of the mysteries of vanishing light , spoils us to such a degree that almost all other musicians seem too robust afterwards . <end>
<unchecked> <start> If you will believe me , the highest con caption of Wagner is not to be got from what at present pleases in his works . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That has been in vented to persuade the masses one of our class bounds back in presence of it , as before an all too impudent fresco . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What do we care for the alicante brutality of the Overture of Tannhauser ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> or for the Circus of the valkyrie ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Whatever has become popular in Wagner s music apart from the theatre is of a doubtful flavour and spoils the taste . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The Tannhauser March seems to me to raise a suspicion of Philistinism the Overture of the Plying Dutchman is much ado about nothing the Prelude to Lohengrin gave the first ex ample , only too insidious , only too successful , of how one may hypnotise with music I dislike all music that has no higher ambition than to persuade the nerves . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Apart , however , from Wagner the magnetised and fresco painter , there is yet a Wagner who deposits little jewels in his works , our greatest melancholic in music , full of flashes , delicacies , and words of comfort in which no one has anticipated him , the master of the tones of a melancholy and comatose happiness . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A lexicon of the most familiar language of Wagner , nothing but short phrases of from five to fifteen measures , nothing but music which nobody knows . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Wagner had the virtue of the decadent , pity . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Very good ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> But how can one lose one s taste for this decadent , if one is not perchance a musician , if one is not perchance a decadent one s self ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Re tersely ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> How is it we can t do it ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Just attempt it ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> You are not aware who Wagner is he is quite a great stage player ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Does there at all exist a more profound , a more oppressive effect in the theatre ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Do look at these youths numbed , pale , and breathless ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> They are wagnerian , they understand nothing of music and nevertheless Wagner becomes master over them . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Wagner s art presses with the weight of a hundred atmospheres : bow yourselves just , it is unavoidable . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Wagner the stage player is a tyrant , his pathos overthrows every kind of taste , every kind of resistance . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Who has such convincing power of attitude , who sees the attitude so definitely be fore everything else ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> This holding the breath of Wagnerian pathos , this unwillingness to let an ex tree feeling escape , this dread inspiring duration of conditions where momentary suspense is enough to choke one ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Was Wagner a musician at all ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> At least he was something else in a higher degree , namely , an in comparable listric , the greatest mime , the most astonishing theatrical genius that the Germans have had , our scenic artist par excellence . <end>
<unchecked> <start> His place is elsewhere than in the history of music , with the grand true geniuses of winch he must not be confounded . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Wagner and Beethoven that is a blasphemy and in the end an injustice even to Wagner . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He was also as a musician only that which he vas in other respects : he became a musician , he became a poet , because the tyrant in him , his stage player genius compelled him to it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> One finds out nothing about Wagner as long as one has not found out his dome eating instinct . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Wagner was not a musician by instinct . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He proved this himself by abandoning all lawfulness , and to speak more definitely all style in music , in order to make out of it what he required , a theatrical the topic , a means for expression , for strengthening attic tubes , for suggestion , for the psychologically picture issue . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Wagner might here pass for an inventor and an innovator of the first rank he has idea surely increased tie speaking power of music he is the Victor Hugo of music as language . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Pro video always one grants that music may , under cer tain conditions , not be music , but speech , tool , or ancillary dramaturgical . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Wagner s music , not protection by theatrical taste , a very tolerant taste , is simply bad music , perhaps the worst that has ever been made . <end>
<unchecked> <start> When a musician can no longer count three , he becomes dramatic , he becomes Wagnerian . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Wagner has almost discovered what magic can be wrought with a music decomposed and reduced , as it were , to the elementary . <end>
<unchecked> <start> His consciousness of it goes so far as to be disquieting , like his instinct for finding a higher lawfulness and a style unnecessary . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The element try suffices sound , movement , colour , in short , the sensuality of music . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Wagner never calculates as a musician from any kind of musical conscience he wants effect , he wants nothing but effect . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And he knows that on which he has to operate ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> He has , in this respect , the scrupulousness which Schiller pos sensed , which every one possesses who is connected with the stage he has also Schiller s contempt for the w r world , which has to sit at his feet . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A person is a in virtue of having a certain discernment in advance of other men , viz . <end>
<unchecked> <start> that what has to operate as true must not be true at all . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The proposition has been formulated by alma : it contains the entire psychology of the stage player , it contains let us not doubt it his morality also . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Wagner s music is never true . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But it is taken as true , and so it is all right . <end>
<unchecked> <start> As long as people continue childish , and Wagnerian in addition , they think of Wagner even as rich , as a paragon of lavishness , as a great landed proprietor in the empire of sound . <end>
<unchecked> <start> They admire in him what young French people admire in Victor Hugo , the royal generosity . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Later on people admire both of them for the very reverse reasons : as masters and models of economy , as prudent . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Nobody equals them in the ability to present an apparently princely table at a modest cost . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The Wagnerian , with his devout stomach , becomes satiated even with the fare which his master conjures up for him . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We others , however , who , alike in books and in music , want sub stance more than anything else , and for whom merely represented feasts hardly suffice , we are much worse off . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Speaking plainly , Wagner does not give us enough to chew . <end>
<unchecked> <start> His little meat , some what more bone , and very much sauce has been christened by me Alia genoese herewith I cer mainly do not mean to flatter the Genoese , but rather the older recitative , the recitative sacco . <end>
<unchecked> <start> As for the Wagnerian leading motive , I lack all culinary in intelligence for it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> If I were pressed , I would perhaps assign to it the value of an ideal toothpick , as an occasion for dispensing with the rest of the food . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The arias of Wagner are still left . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And now I do not say a word more . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In sketching dramatic action , likewise , Wagner is above all a stage player . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That which first suggests itself to him is a scene with an absolutely sure effect , a veritable actio , with a hat relief of gesture , a scene Note . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It has been a veritable misfortune for aesthetics that the word drama has always been translated by action . <end>
<unchecked> <start> wagner is not the only one who errs here all the world is still in error about the matter even the philologists , who ought to know better . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The ancient drama had grand pathetic scenes in view , it just excluded action relegated it previous to the commencement , or behind the scene . <end>
<unchecked> <start> which upsets he thinks this out thoroughly , it is only out of this that he derives his characters . <end>
<unchecked> <start> All the rest follows therefrom in accordance with a tech nicol economy which has no reasons to be subtle . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is not the public of Corneille Wagner has to indulge it is merely the nineteenth century . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Wagner would decide with regard to the one thing needful in much the same manner as every other stage player decides now a days : a series of strong scenes , each stronger than the other , and much sage stupidity in between . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He seeks first of all to guarantee to him self the effect of his work he begins with the third act , he tests for himself his work by its final effect . <end>
<unchecked> <start> With such a theatrical talent for guide , one is in no danger of creating a drama unawares . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A drama requires hard logic : but what did Wagner ever care about logic ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let us repeat : it was not the public of Corneille he had to indulge , it was mere Ger mans ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> One knows the technical problem in solving which the dramatist applies all his power and often sweats blood : to give necessity to the plot , and like wise to the denouement , so that both are possible only in one way , so that both give the impression of free dom principle of the least expenditure of force . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Now The word drama is of Doric origin , and according to Dorian usage signifies event , history , both words in a hieratic sense . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The oldest drama represented local legend , the sacred history on which the establishment of the cult rested consequently no doing , but a happening : in Dorian does not at all signify to do . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Wagner sweats the least blood here it is certain that he makes the least expenditure of force on plot and denouement . <end>
<unchecked> <start> You may put any one of Wagner s plots under the microscope I promise you will have to laugh at that you see . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Nothing more en likening than the plot of Tristan , unless it be that of the Master singers . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Wagner is not a dramatist let us not be imposed upon ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> He loved the word drama that was all he always loved fancy words . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The word drama , in his writings , is nevertheless purely a misunderstanding and shrewd policy : Wagner al ways affected superiority toward the word opera , much in the same manner as the word spirit in the New Testament is purely a misunderstanding . <end>
<unchecked> <start> From the first , he was not enough of a psychologist for the drama he avoided instinctively psychological motive tion . <end>
<unchecked> <start> By what means ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> By always putting idiocy crash in its place . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Very modern , is it not ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> very Parisian ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> very decadent . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The plots , let us say in passing , which Wagner really knows how to work out by means of dramatic invention , are of quite an other kind . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I give an example . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let us take the case of Wagner requiring a woman s voice . <end>
<unchecked> <start> An entire act without a woman s voice that does not do ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> But for the moment none of the heroines are free . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What does Wagner do ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> He emancipated the oldest woman in the world , era . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Up ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> old grandmother ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> You have got to sing ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> era sings . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Wagner s purpose is served . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He immediately discharges the old dame again . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Why really did you come ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Retire ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Please go to sleep again ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> In summat : a scene full of mythological horrors , which makes the wagnerian imaginative . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But the contents of the Wagnerian texts ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> their mythical contents , their eternal contents ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Question : How does one test these contents , these eternal con tents ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> The chemist gives the reply : one translates Wagner into the real , into the modern let us be still more cruel , into civil life ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> What then becomes of Wagner ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> To speak in confidence , I have attempted it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Nothing more entertaining , nothing more recommendable for pleasure walks , than to recount Wagner to one s self in more modern proportions : for example , Parsifal as a candidate in divinity , with a public school education the latter indispensable for pure folly . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What surprises one then experiences ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Would you believe it that the Wagnerian heroines , each and all , when one has only stripped them of their heroic trap pings , are like counterparts of Madame Bovary ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> And how one comprehends , inversely , that Flaubert was at liberty to translate his heroine into standi avian , or Carthaginian , and then to offer her , mythologies , to Wagner as a libretto . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Yes , taken as a whole , Wagner appears to have had no interest in any other problems than those which at present interest Nietzsche here refers to the etymology of Parsifal pure fool which Wagner adopted . <end>
<unchecked> <start> petty Parisian decadent . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Always just five steps from the hospital ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Nothing but quite modern problems , nothing but problems of a great city ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> don t you doubt it ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Have you remarked it belongs to this associate tion of ideas that the Wagnerian heroines have no children ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> They cannon have children . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The despair with which Wagner has dealt with the problem of permitting Siegfried to be born at all , reveals how modern his sentiments were on this point . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Siegfried emancipated woman but without hope of posterity . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Finally , a fact which perplexed us : Parsifal is the father of Lohengrin ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> How has he done that ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Have we here to recollect that chastity works miracles ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> wagner dixit princeps in castigate . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A word yet , in passing , concerning Wagner s writings : they are among other things , a school of expediency . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The system of procedure which Wagner uses , is to be employed in a hundred other cases , he that hath an ear , let him hear . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Perhaps I shall have a claim to public gratitude , if I give precise expression to his three most valuable principles of procedure : Whatever Wagner cannon accomplish is objection able . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Wagner might accomplish much more , but he is unwilling owing to strictness of principle . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Whatever Wagner can accomplish , no one will imitate , no one has anticipated , no one ought to imi tate . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Wagner is divine . <end>
<unchecked> <start> These three propositions are the quintessence of Wagner s writings : the rest is literature . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Not all the music up till now has had need of literature : one does well here to seek for a satisfactory reason . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Is it that Wagner s music is too difficult to understand ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Or did he fear the contrary , that it would be understood too easily , that it would not be difficult enough to understand ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> In fact , he has all his life repeated one phrase : that his music does not simply mean music ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> But more ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Infinitely more ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Not simply music no musician speaks in such a manner ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let it be said once more , Wagner was un able to cut out of the block he had no choice at all , he was obliged to make patch work motives , attic tubes , formulae , duplications , as a musician he remained a rhetorician : on that account he was compelled as a matter of principle to bring the device , It implies , into the foreground . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Music is always just a means that was his theory , that w as the only praxis at all possible for him . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But no musician thinks in such a way . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Wagner had need of literal sure in order to persuade all the world to take his music seriously , to take it as profound , because it meant Infinity all his life he was the commentator of the Idea . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What does Elsa signify ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> There is no doubt however : Elsa is the unconscious spirit of the people with this idea I necessarily developed into a complete revolutionise . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let us recollect that Wagner was young when Hegel and Schelling led men s minds astray that he found out , that he grasped firmly what only a German takes seriously the Idea , that is to say , something obscure , uncertain , mysterious that among Germans clearness is an objection , and logic is disproof . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Schopenhauer has , with severity , accused the epoch of Hegel and Schelling of dishonesty with severity , and also with injustice : he himself , the old pessimistic false corner , has in no way acted more honestly than his more celebrated contemporaries . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let us leave morality out of the game : Hegel is a flavour . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And hot only a German , but a European flavour ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> A flavour which Wagner understood ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> which he felt himself equal to ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> which he has immortalised ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> He merely made application of it to music he invented for himself a style which meant Infinity he be came the heir of hegel . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Music as Idea And how Wagner was understood ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> The same sort of men who were enthusiastic for Hegel , are at pre sent enthusiastic for Wagner : in his school Hegelian is even written Above all , the German youth understood him . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The two words , infinite and sign finance quite sufficed he enjoyed an incomparable pleasure in hearing them . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is not with music that Wagner has won the youth over to himself , it is with the Idea : it is the of his art , its game of hide and seek among a hundred symbols , its polychrome of the ideal , which has led and alluded these youths to Wagner ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> it is Wagner s genius for forming clouds , his gripping , sweeping and roving through the air , his ubiquity and precisely the same proceedings with w which once Hegel misled and seduced the youths ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> In the midst of Wagner s multiplicity , fullness , and arbitrariness , they are justified , as it were , in their o in eyes they are saved . <end>
<unchecked> <start> They hear with trembling how in his art the sublime symbols become audible with gentle thunder out of the cloudy distance they are not out of temper if the atmosphere here sometimes becomes grey , frightful , and cold . <end>
<unchecked> <start> For they are each and all related to bad weather , German w r either , like Wagner himself ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Woden is their God : Woden , however , is the God of bad w r either . <end>
<unchecked> <start> They are right , these German youths , such as they are : how could they miss in Wagner what w r e others , we Halcyonians , miss in him : la gay a science light feet wit , fire , grace , lofty logic the dance of the stars , haughty intellect quality the tremor of southern light the smooth sea perfection . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I have explained where Wagner belongs to not to the history of music . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Nevertheless , what is his import for the history of music ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> The advent of the stage player in music : a momentous event , which gives occasion to reflect , perhaps also to fear . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In a for mala , Wagner and Liszt . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Never has the upright ness of musicians , their genuineness , been put to such a dangerous test . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is easily enough understood : great success , the success with the masses , is no longer on the side of genuineness , one has to be a in order to obtain it ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Victor Hugo and Richard Wagner they imply one and the same truth , that in declining civilisations , wherever the arbitrating power falls into the hands of the masses , genuineness becomes superfluous , disadvantageous , and a drawback . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is only the stage player that still awakens great enthusiasm . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Thus dawns the golden age for the stage player for him and all that is related to his species . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Wagner marches with drums and files at the head of all the artists of elocution , of display , of virtuosity he has first con winced the leaders of the orchestras , the machinists , and theatrical singers . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Not to forget the musicians of the orchestra : he saved them from tedium . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The movement which Wagner created encroached even on the domain of knowledge entire sciences belonging thereto emerge slowly out of a scholasticism which is centuries old . <end>
<unchecked> <start> To give an example , I call special attention to the service which Riemann has rendered to rhythmic he is the first who has made current the essential idea of punctuation in music it is a pity that by means of an ugly word he calls it phrasing . <end>
<unchecked> <start> All these , I say it with gratitude , are the best , the most worthy of regard , among the worshippers of Wagner they are simply right to worship Wagner . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The same instinct unites them with one another , they see in him their highest type , they feel themselves transformed and elevated to power , even to great power , ever since he inflamed them with his peculiar ardour . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Here indeed , if anywhere , the in fluency of Wagner has really been beneficent . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In this sphere , there has never been so much thought , so much purpose , so much work . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Wagner has inspired all these artists with a new conscience : what they at present require of themselves , what they obtain from themselves , they have never required before Wagner s time formerly they w ere too modest for that . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A different spirit rules in the theatre since the spirit of Wagner began to rule there : the most difficult is demanded , there is severe blaming , there is rarely praising , the good , the excellent , is regarded as the rule . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Taste is no longer necessary not even voice . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Wagner is only sung with a ruined voice : that has a dramatic effect . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Even talent is excluded . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The at any price , such as is demanded by the Wagnerian ideal , the decadence ideal , gets along badly with talent . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Virtue only is the proper thing here that is to say , drilling , automatism , self denial . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Neither taste , nor voice , nor talent : there is only one thing needful for Wagner s stage germanic . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Definition of germanic : obedience and long legs . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is full of deep significance that the advent of Wagner coincides with the advent of the Empire both facts furnish proof of one and the same thing obedience and long legs . <end>
<unchecked> <start> There has never been better obedience there has never been better commanding . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The Wag nerina musical directors , in particular , are worthy of an age which posterity will one day designate with timorous reverence , the classical age of war . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Wagner understood how to command by that means he was the great teacher also . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He commanded as the index oracle will to himself , as the life long discipline of himself : Wagner , who perhaps furnishes the most striking example of self tyranny which the history of art supplies even Alfieri , otherwise most nearly related to him , has been surpassed . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Remark of a turbines . <end>
<unchecked> <start> By means of this insight that our stage players are more worthy of adoration than ever , their dangerousness has not been conceived as less . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But who yet doubts what I am after what are the three demands for which my resentment , my solicit tube , and my love for art , have at present opened my mouth ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> That the theatre may not become the master of art . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That the stage player may not become the corrupted of the genuine ones . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That music may not become an art of lying . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The gravity of the last words permits me in this place to communicate in addition some passages from an imprinted dissertation , which at least leave no doubt concerning my seriousness in this matter . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The dissertation is entitled , What Wagner costs us . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The adherence to Wagner costs dear . <end>
<unchecked> <start> An obscure consciousness of this still exists at present . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Even Wagner s success , his triumph , did not outlook this feeling radically . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But formerly it was strong , it was formidable , it was like a gloomy hatred throughout almost three fourths of Wagner s life time . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That resistance which he encountered among us Germans , cannon be estimated highly enough , nor sufficiently honoured . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We defended ourselves against him as against a disease not with arguments one does not refute a disease , but with obstruction , with mistrust , with aversion , with loathing , with a sullen seriousness , as if a great danger prowled around us in him . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The aesthetic gentlemen compromised them selves , when , out of three schools of German philo sophy they made an absurd attack upon Wagner s principles with if and for what did he care for principles , even his own ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> The Germans , however , have had enough of reason in their instincts to pro habit themselves every if and for in this matter . <end>
<unchecked> <start> An instinct is weakened when it is rationalised for by rationalising itself it weakens itself . <end>
<unchecked> <start> If there are indications that , in spite of the totality of European decadence , there yet resides in the German character a degree of , an instinctive scent for what is injurious and threatens danger , I should like least of all to see this stolid resistance to Wagner under valued among us . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It does honour to us , it permits us even to hope : P rance could no longer dis sense with so much . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The Germans , the regarders par excellence in history , are at present the most backward among , the civilised peoples of Europe : this has its advantage , they are thus re natively the youngest . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The adherence to Wagner costs dear . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The Ger mans have only quite lately unlearned a sort of dread of him the desire to get rid of him came upon them on every occasion . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Do you recollect a curious NOTE . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Was Wagner German at all ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> We have some reasons for asking this . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is difficult to discover in him any German trait whatsoever . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Being a great learner , he has learned to imitate occurrence , in which , just at the end , that old feeling again , quite unexpectedly , made its appearance ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> It happened at the funeral of Wagner that the first Wagner Society in Germany , that of Munich , depo sited on his tomb a wreath , the inscription on which immediately became celebrated . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Salvation to the Saviour ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> was how it read . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Everybody admired the sublime inspiration which had dictated this inscription , everybody admired a taste in which the partisans of Wagner have a privilege but many also it was singular enough ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> made the same little correction in the inscription : Salvation from the Saviour ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> People recovered breath . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The adherence to Wagner costs dear . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let us measure it in its effect upon civilisation . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Whom has his movement really brought into the foreground ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> What has it more and more reared into magnitude ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> More than anything else , the arrogance of the layman , of the idiotic art amateur . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He organises societies that is German that is all . <end>
<unchecked> <start> His character itself is in oppo position to what has hitherto been regarded as German not to speak of the German musician ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> His father was a stage player named Geyer . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A Geyer is almost an Adler . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What has hitherto been put in circulation as the Life of Wagner is fable converted , if not worse . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I confess my distrust of every point which rests solely on the testimony of Wagner himself . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He had not pride enough for any truth whatsoever about himself , nobody was less proud he remained , just like Victor Hugo , true to himself even in biographical matters , he remained a stage player . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Geyer vulture and Adler eagle are both names of Jewish families . <end>
<unchecked> <start> now , he wants to make his taste prevail , he would like even to become the judge in rebus musics et . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In the second place , an ever greater indifference to all severe , noble , conscientious training in the service of art the belief in genius substituted for it in plain words , insolent the for mala for it is to be found in the Master singers . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In the third place , and worst of all , Theatrocracy the absurdity of a belief in a precedence of the theatre , in the right of sovereignty of the theatre over the arts , over art . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But one has to tell the wagnerian a hundred times to their face what the theatre is : always just something in superposition to art , always something merely secondary , something vol raised , something suitably adapted for the masses , suitably falsified for them . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Even Wagner has changed nothing of that : Bayreuth is big opera but never good opera . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The theatre is a form of in matters of taste , the theatre is an insurrection of the masses , a plebiscite against good taste . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The case of Wagner just proves this : he gained the multitude , he depraved the taste , he depraved even our taste for the opera ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> The adherence to Wagner costs dear . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What does it make of the mind ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Does Wagner free the mind ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> He is possessed of every ambiguity , every equip vocation , everything , in fact , which persuades the undecided , without making them conscious what they are persuaded to . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Wagner is thereby a seducer in the grand style . <end>
<unchecked> <start> There is nothing fatigued , nothing decrepit , nothing dangerous to life and derogatory to the world in spiritual matters , which would not be secretly taken under protection by his art , it is the blackest obscurantism which he conceals in the luminous husks of the ideal . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He flatters every nihil stick buddhist instinct and disguises it in music , he flatters every kind of Christianity , and every religious form of expression of decadence . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let us open our ears : everything that has grown up on the soil of impoverished life , the entire false coinage of transcendence and another world , has in Wagner s art its sublime advocate not in formulae Wagner is too prudent to use formulae , but in persuasion of sensuality , which , in its turn , again makes the mind tender and fatigued . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Music as Circe . <end>
<unchecked> <start> His last w or is in this respect his greatest masterpiece . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Parsifal will always maintain the chief place in the art of seduction , as its stroke of genius . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I admire that work , I should like to have composed it myself not having done so , at least understand it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Wagner was never better inspired than at the end . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The in the alliance of beauty and disease is here carried so far that it casts , as it were , a shadow over Wagner s earlier art : it appears too bright , too healthy . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Do you understand that ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Health and bright ness acting as a shadow ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> as an objection almost ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> We are so far pure fools already . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Never was there a greater connoisseur of musty , hieratic perfumes , there never lived such an expert in the knowledge of all the little infinite , of all the tremulous and ex exuberant , of all the feminism in the thesaurus of hap pines ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Just drink , my friends , the philtres of this art ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> You nowhere find a more pleasant mode of generating your mind , of forgetting your manliness under a rose bush . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Ah ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> this old magician ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> This klinger of all the klingons ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> How he makes war against us therewith ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> against us , the free spirits ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> How he humours every cowardice of modern soul with Siren tones ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> There was never such a mortal hatred of knowledge ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> One here requires to be a Cynic to escape being seduced one requires to be able to bite to avoid worshipping . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Well ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> old seducer ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> The Cynic warns thee cave cane . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The adherence to Wagner costs dear . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I observe the youths who have long been exposed to his infection . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The proximate effect , relatively innocent , relates to taste . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Wagner s influence is like a continuous use of alcohol . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It dulls , it obstructs the stomach with phlegm . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Specific effect : degeneracy of the sense of rhythm . <end>
<unchecked> <start> TheWagnerian at last comes to call rhythmical , what I myself , borrowing a Greek proverb , call agitating the swamp . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The corruption of the conceptions is undoubtedly much more dangerous . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The youth be comes a moon calf an idealist . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He has gotPOSTSCRIPTbeyond science , in that respect he stands at the height of the master . <end>
<unchecked> <start> On the other hand , he plays the phi he writes Bayreuth journals he solves all problems in the name of the Father , the Son , and the Holy Master . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The most disquieting thing , to be sure , is the ruin of the nerves . <end>
<unchecked> <start> You may go at night through any of the larger cities , and everywhere you hear instruments violated with solemn fury a savage howling mingling therewith . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What is taking place ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> the youths are worshipping Wagner . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Bayreuth rhymes itself with establishment . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A typical telegram from Bayreuth : berets bereft red already . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Wagner is bad for youths he is fatal to women . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What , in medical language , is a Wagnerienne ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> It seems to me that a physician could not put this conscience alternative with too much seriousness to brides : either the one or the other . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But they have already made their choice . <end>
<unchecked> <start> One cannon serve two masters if one of them is called Wagner . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Wagner has saved woman , therefore woman has built Bayreuth for him . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Entire sacrifice , entire devotion , they have nothing they would not give him . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Woman impoverished herself in favour of the master , she becomes touching , she stands naked before him . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The Wagnerienne the most gracious to be found at present : she embodies Wagner s cause in her sign , his cause triumphs . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Ah , this old robber ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> He plunders us of our youths , he takes even our women as plunder , and drags them into his cavern . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Ah , this old Mino tour ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> What he has already cost us ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Every year trains of the finest maidens and youths are led into his lay ninth , that he may devour them , every year all Europe strikes up the cry : Off to Crete ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Off to Crete ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> SECOND POSTSCRIPT My letter , it appears , is liable to a misapprehension . <end>
<unchecked> <start> On certain countenances the indications of gratitude show themselves I hear even a discreet mirth . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I should prefer here , as in many things , to be understood . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But since a new animal ravages in the vineyards of German intellect , the Empire worm , celebrated Rhinoxera , nothing I say is any longer understood . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The Kreuzzeitung itself attests this to me , not to speak of the Literarisches Centralblatt . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I have given to the Germans the profoundest books they at all possess a sufficient reason why they should not understand a word of them . <end>
<unchecked> <start> If in this work I make an attack on Wagner and incidentally on a German taste , if I have hard words for the Bayreuth cretinism , I should like least of all to make an entertainment therewith for any other musicians . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Other musicians do not come into consideration in presence of Wagner . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Things are bad everywhere . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The decay is universal . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The disease is deep seated . <end>
<unchecked> <start> If Wagner s name type lies the ruin of music , as Bernini s name typifies the ruin of sculpture , he is not by any means its cause . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He has only accelerated its tempo , to be sure , in such a way that one stands frightened before the almost instantaneous descent , downwards , into the abyss . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He had the naivete of decadence : that was his superiority . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He believed in it , he did not stop before any logic of decadence . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The others hesitate that distinguishes them . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Nothing else ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> That which Wagner and the others have in common I enure rate it : the decline of organising power the abuse of traditional means without the justifying capacity , that of attaining the end the false coinage in the imi station of great forms , for which at present nobody is sufficiently strong , sufficiently proud , sufficiently self-confident , or sufficiently healthy the of the smallest details emotion at any price refinement as the expression of impoverished life always more nerves in place of flesh . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I know only one musician who is at present still in a position to cut an overture out of the block , and nobody knows him . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What is at present famous does not create better music in comparison with Wagner s , but only music which is more index decisive , more indifferent : more indifferent , because the incomplete is set aside by the presence of the com It is Peter last , a disciple and friend of Nietzsche , who is here referred to . <end>
<unchecked> <start> plec . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Wagner was complete but he was complete cor eruption he was courage , he was will , he was convict tion in corruption of what import , then , is Johannes Brahms ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> His good fortune was a German mis apprehension : he was taken for Wagner s antagonist , an antagonist to Wagner vas needed ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> That does not produce indispensable music , it produces in the first instance too much music ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> If you are not rich , be proud enough for poverty ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> The sympathy which Brahms here and there undeniably inspires , apart altogether from such party interest and party misunderstanding , was for a long time an enigma to me , until finally , almost by accident , I came to perceive that he operated on a certain type of persons . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He has the melancholy of impotency he does not create out of plenitude , he is thirsty for plenitude . <end>
<unchecked> <start> If one deducts his imitations , what he borrows either from the great ancient or the exotic modern forms of style he is a master in the art of copying , there remains , as his most striking peculiarity , the longing mood . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That is divined by all who long , by all who are dissatisfied . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He is too little of a person , too little centralised . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That is what the impersonal , the understand , they love him on that account . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He is especially the must can of a class of unsatisfied ladies . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Fifty paces further on we find the Wagnerienne just as we find Wagner fifty paces further on than Brahms , the Wagnerienne , a better stamped , more interesting , and , above all , a more gracious type . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Brahms is moving , as long as he is in secret reveries , or mourns over himself in that he is modern he becomes cold , he is of no more interest to us , mime lately that he becomes the heir of the classics . <end>
<unchecked> <start> One likes to speak of Brahms as the heir of Beethoven : I know of no more considerate euphemism . <end>
<unchecked> <start> All that at present makes pretensions to the grand style in music is thereby either false with respect to us , or false with respect to itself . <end>
<unchecked> <start> This alternative is suffix gently thought worthy , for it involves a casuistry with regard to the worth of the two cases . <end>
<unchecked> <start> False with respect to us : the instinct of most people protests against that they do not want to be deceived though I myself , to be sure , should still prefer this type to the other false with respect to itself . <end>
<unchecked> <start> This is my taste . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Expressed more simply for the poor in spirit : Brahms or Wagner . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Brahms is no stage player . <end>
<unchecked> <start> One may subsume a good many of the other musicians under the conception of Brahms . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I do not say a word of the sagacious apes of Wagner , for example , of goldman : with his Queen of sheba one belongs to the menagerie one may exhibit one s self . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What can be done well at present , what can be done in a masterly manner , is only the small things . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is here only that honesty is still possible . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Nothing , however , can cure music in the main thing , of the main thing , of the fatality of being the expression of a physiological contradiction , of being modern . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The best instruction , the most conscientious schooling , the most thorough intimacy with the old masters , yea , even isolation in their society all that is only palliative , or , speaking more strictly , illusory because one has no longer the physical capacity which is presupposed : be it that of the strong race of a Handel , be it the overflowing animality of a Rossini . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Not everyone has the right to every teacher : that is true of whole epochs . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The possibility is not in itself excluded that there still exist , somewhere in Europe , remains of stronger races , men typically in opportune : from thence a delayed beauty and perfection even for music might still be hoped for . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is only exceptions we can still experience under the best circumstances . <end>
<unchecked> <start> From the rule that corruption is pre talent , that corruption is fatalistic , no God can save music . <end>
<unchecked> <start> EPILOGUE Let us finally , in order to take breath , withdraw for a moment from the narrow world to which all questions concerning the worth of persons condemn the mind . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A philosopher requires to wash his hands after he has so long occupied himself with the case of Wagner . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I give my conception of the Modern . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Every age has in its quantum of energy , a quantum determining what virtues are permitted to it , what virtues are proscribed . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It has either the vir tues of ascending life , and then it resists to the utter most the virtues of descending life or it is itself an epoch of descending life , and then it requires the virtues of decline , then it hates all that justifies itself solely by plenitude , by superabundance of strength . <end>
<unchecked> <start> aesthetics is indissolubly bound up with these biological presuppositions : there is decadence aesthetics , and there is classical aesthetics , the beautiful in it self is a chimera , like all idealism . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In the narrower sphere of so called moral values there is no greater contrast than that of master morality and morality according to Christian valuation : the latter grown up on a thoroughly morbid soil the Gospels present to us precisely the same physiological types which the romances of dostoievsky depict master morality Roman , heathen , classical , Renaissance re tersely , as the symbolic language of well of ascending life , of the will to power as the principle of life . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Master morality affirms , just as instinctively as Christian morality denies God , the other world , self renunciation nothing but negation . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The former communicates to things out of its fullness it glorifies , it embellished , it rationalise the world , the latter im perishes , branches , and mars the value of things , it denies the world . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The world , a Christian term of insult . <end>
<unchecked> <start> These antithetical forms in the optics of values are both indispensable : they are modes of seeing which one does not reach with reasons and refutations . <end>
<unchecked> <start> One does not refute Christianity , one does not refute a disease of the eye . <end>
<unchecked> <start> To have combated pessimism as one combats a philosophy was the acme of learned idiocy . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The concepts true and untrue have not , as it seems to me , any meaning in optics . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That against which alone one has to defend one s self is the falsity , the instinctive duplicity , which will not be sen bible of these antitheses as antitheses : as was the case with Wagner , for example , who possessed no little masterless in such falsifies . <end>
<unchecked> <start> To look enviously towards master morality , noble morality the Icelandic legend is almost its most important document , and at the same time to have in his mouth the contrary doctrine , the Gospel of the Lowly , the need of salvation ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> In passing , let me say that I admire the modesty of the Christians who go to Bayreuth . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I myself should not endure certain words out of the mouth of Wagner . <end>
<unchecked> <start> There are conceptions which do not belong to Bay ruth . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> A Christianity adjusted for Wagneriennes , perhaps by Wagneriennes for Wagner in his old days was positively feminine generis ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let me say once more that the Christians of today are too modest for me . <end>
<unchecked> <start> If Wagner was a Christian , then Liszt w r as perhaps a Church Father ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> The need of salvation , the essence of all Christian needs , has nothing to do with such harlequins it is the sincerest form of ex expression of decadence , the most convinced and most painful affirmation of it in sublime symbols and prac times . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The Christian wishes to get loose from himself . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Le moi est tumours Jiaissable . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Noble morality , master morality , has , reverse , its roots in a triumphing affirmation , it is the self affirming , the of life it equally needs sublime symbols and practices , but only because its heart is too full . <end>
<unchecked> <start> All beautiful art , all great art belongs here : the essence of both is gratitude . <end>
<unchecked> <start> On the other hand , one from it an instinctive aversion from the dec. <end>
<unchecked> <start> dents , a disdain , a horror even , before their symbolism : such is almost its demonstration . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The noble Roman recognised Christianity as a fee da superstition I here remind you how Goethe , the last German of noble taste , felt with regard to the cross . <end>
<unchecked> <start> One seeks in vain for more valuable , for more indispensable contrasts . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But such a falsity as that of the Bayreuthians is now no exception . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We all know the anaesthetic conception of the Christian gentleman . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Indeed that innocence in the midst of contradictions , that good conscience in lying , is modern par excellence one almost defines modernism by it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Modern man represents biologically a contradiction of moral values , he sits between two chairs , he says in one breath , Yea and Nay . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What wonder , then , that just in our time , falsity itself became flesh and even genius ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> what wonder that Wagner dwelt among us ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> It was not without reason that I named Wagner the Cagliostro of modernism . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But we all , unconsciously and involuntarily , have in our selves standards , phrases , formulae , and moralities of Note . <end>
<unchecked> <start> My Genealogy of Morals furnished the first in formation concerning the contrast between noble morality and Chris tian morality there is perhaps no more decisive modification of thought in the history of religious and moral knowledge . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That book , my touch stone for what belongs to me , has the good fortune to be accessible only to the most elevated and the most rigorous minds : others have not got ears for it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> One has to have one s passion in things , where nobody has it at present contradictory origin , regarded physiologically , we are spurious . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A diagnostic of modern soul what would it commence with ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> With a resolute incision into this contradictoriness of instincts , with the dissent angling of its antithetical moral values , with a vivisection performed on its most instructive case . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The case of Wagner is a fortunate case for the philosopher this work , one hears , is inspired by gratitude . <end>
<unchecked> <start> NIETZSCHE CONTRA WAGNER : THE BRIEF OF A PSYCHOLOGISTPREFACE The following chapters are all rather carefully select ed out of my older writings some of them go back to , they are perhaps simplified here and there , above all , they are shortened . <end>
<unchecked> <start> When read in succession , they will leave no doubt concerning either Richard Wagner or myself : we are antipodes . <end>

<unchecked> <start> WHERE I ADMIRE I believe artists often do not know what they can do best : they are too conceited for that . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Their attention is directed to something prouder than those little plants give promise of , which know how to grow up in actual perfection , new , rare , and beauty ful , on their soil . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The final excellency of their own garden and vineyard is superficially estimated by them , and their love and their insight are not of equal quality . <end>
<unchecked> <start> There is a musician , who , more than any other , has the genius for finding the tones peru liar to suffering , oppressed , tortured souls , and even for giving speech to dumb misery . <end>
<unchecked> <start> No one equals him in the colours of the late autumn , the baby pathetic happiness of a last , alder last , enjoyment he knows a sound for those secretly haunted midnight of the soul when cause and effect seem to have gone out of joint and every instant something can originate out of nothing . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He draws his resources best of all out of the lowest depth of human happiness , and as it were out of its drained goblet , where the bitterest and most nauseous drops have at the end the good or the bad ended with the sweetest . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He knows that weary of the soul which can no longer leap or fly , yea , not even talk he has the shy glance of pain that is concealed , of understanding without comfort , of leave taking without confession yea , as the Orpheus of all secret misery , he is greater than anyone , and much has been added to art through him only , much which was hitherto inexpressible and even seemingly unworthy of art the cynical revolts , for example , of which only the greatest sufferers are capable , and likewise many quite small and microscopic matters belonging to the soul , as it were the scales of its amphibious nature , yes , he is the master of minutiae . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But he does not willi to be so ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> His character loves rather the large walls and the audacious wall pain ting . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He fails to observe that his spirit has a different taste and inclination antithetical optics , and likes best of all to sit quietly in the corners of broken down houses : concealed there , concealed from himself , he paints his proper master pieces , which are all very short , often only one measure in length , it is not till there that he becomes quite good , great , and perfect , perhaps there only . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Wagner is one who has suffered sorely that is his pre eminence over the other must cans . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I admire Wagner in everything in which he sets himself to music . <end>
<unchecked> <start> WHERE I MAKE OBJECTIONS That is not to say that I regard this music as healthy , and there least of all where it speaks of Wagner . <end>
<unchecked> <start> My objections to Wagner s music are physio logical objections : for what purpose is to be served by disguising the same under aesthetic formulae ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> aesthetics is certainly nothing but applied Physiology . <end>
<unchecked> <start> My matter of fact , my petit fait rai , is that I no longer breathe easily when once this music operates on me , that my foot immediately becomes angry at it and revolts : my foot has need of measure , dance , march even the young German Kaiser cannon march according to Wagner s Kaiser march , my foot desires first of all from music the raptures which lie in good walking , stepping , and dancing . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But does not my stomach also protest ? <end>

<unchecked> <start> my circulation ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> do not my bowels fret ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Do I not unawares become hoarse thereby . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In order to listen to Wagner I need pastilles Ge braudel . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And so I ask myself , what is it at all that my whole body specially wants from music ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> For there is no soul . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I believe it wants L s alleviation : as if all the animal functions were to be accelerated by light , bold , wanton , self assured rhythms as if iron , leaden life were to lose its heaviness by golden , tender , unctuous melodies . <end>
<unchecked> <start> My melancholy wants to take its repose in the hiding places of perfection : for that purpose I need music . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But Wagner makes people morbid . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Of what account is the theatre to me ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> The convulsions of its moral ecstasies in which the mob and who is not mob ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> has its satisfaction ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> The whole pantomime of the stage player ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is obvious that I am essentially constituted : I have , from the bottom of my soul , for the theatre this art of the masses par excellence that profound scorn which at present every artist has . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Success in the theatre a person thereby sinks in my estimation , till he is never again seen non success then I prick up my ears and begin to esteem . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But Wagner was the reverse besides the Wagner who had made the lonesome of all music , essentially a theatre man and stage player , perhaps the most enthusiastic that has existed , even as a musician . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And in passing , we would say that if it has been Wagner s theory , the drama is the end , music is always but the means , his praxis , on the contrary , from the beginning to the close , has been , the attitude is the end , the drama , as well as music , is always only the mea . <end>
<unchecked> <start> ns . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Music as a means for elucidating , strengthening , and internalizing the dramatic pantomime and stage player concreteness and the Wagnerian drama only an occasion for many interesting attitudes ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> He possessed , along with all the other instincts , the commanding instincts of a great stage player in all and everything : and , as we have said , also as a musician . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I once made this clear , not without trouble , to a Wagnerian pur sang , clearness and wagnerian ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> I do not say a word more . <end>
<unchecked> <start> There was reason for adding further Be but a little more honest with yourself ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> for we are not in Bayreuth . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In Bayreuth people are only honest in the mass , as in individuals they lie , they deceive themselves . <end>
<unchecked> <start> They leave themselves at home when they go to Bayreuth , they renounce the right to their own tongue and choice , to their taste , even to their courage , as they have it and use it within their own four walls with respect to God and the world . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Nobody takes the most refined sentiments of his art into the theatre with him , least of all the artist who works for the theatre , solitude is wanting , the perfect does not tolerate witnesses . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In the theatre one becomes mob , herd , woman , Pharisee , the most personal conscience succumbs to the levelling charm of the great multitude , there the neighbour rules , there one becomes neighbour . <end>
<unchecked> <start> WAGNER AS A DANGERThe object which recent music pursues in what is at present called by a strong though obscure name infinite melody one can explain to one s self by going into the sea , gradually losing secure footing on the bottom , and finally submitting one s self to the element at discretion : one has to swim . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In older music , in an elegant , or solemn , or passionate to and fro , faster and slower , one had to do something quite different , namely , to dance . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The proportion necessary thereto , the ob service of definite balance in measures of time and intensity , extorted from the soul of the hearer a conti nous consideration , on the contrast between this cooler breeze , which originated from consideration , and the breath of enthusiasm warmed through , the charm of all good music rested . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Richard Wagner wanted another kind of movement he overthrew the physiological pre requisite of previous music . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Swimming , hovering no longer walking , dancing . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Perhaps the decisive word is thereby said . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Infinite melody just seeks to break up all symmetry of measure and intensity , at times it decides it even it has its wealth of invention precisely in what sounded to the ears of former times as rhythmical paradox and abuse . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Out of an imitation , out of a predominance of such a taste , there might arise such a danger to music that a greater could not even be imagined the complete degeneration of rhythmical feeling , chaos in place of rhythm . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The danger reaches its climax when such a music rests always more and more upon entirely naturalistic and pantomime , which , subject to no law of plastic art , desire effect and nothing more . <end>
<unchecked> <start> TheA MUSIC WITHOUT A FUTUREespressivo at any price , and music in the service , in the slavery of attitude that is the end . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> would it really be the first virtue of a per france as the performing musical artists at present seem to believe , to attain under all circumstances a which cannon be surpassed ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Is not this , when applied , for example , to Mozart , the special sin against the spirit of Mozart , the gay , enthusiastic , tender , amorous spirit of Mozart , who , fortunately , was not German , and whose seriousness is a gracious , golden seriousness , and not that of a German Philistine . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Not to mention the seriousness of the marble statue . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But you think that all music is music of the marble statue , that all music must spring forth out of the wall and agitate the hearer to his very bowels . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is only thus that music is said to operate ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Who is there operated upon ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Something on which a noble artist must never operate , the masses ! <end>

<unchecked> <start> A MUSIC WITHOUT A FUTURE Music , of all the arts that know how to grow up on the soil of a certain civilisation , makes its appearance last of the plants , perhaps because it is the most intrinsic , and consequently arrives latest in the autumn and withering of each civilisation . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It was only in the art of the Dutch masters that the soul of the Christian Middle Ages found its dying echo , their tone architecture is the posthumous , though genuine and equally legitimate sister of Gothic . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It was only in Handel s music that the best re echoed out of the soul of Luther and his kin : the heroic Jewish trait , which gave the Reformation a touch of greatness , the Old Testament become music , not the New Testa ment . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It was reserved for Mozart to pay in clinking gold pieces the balance due to the age of Louis XIV and the art of Racine and Claude lorraine it was only in Beethoven s and Rossini s music that the eighteenth century sang itself out , the century of enthusiasm , of broken ideals , and fugitive happiness . <end>
<unchecked> <start> All true , all original music is a swan s song . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Perhaps even our latest music , notwithstanding its predominance and ambition , has but a brief space of time before it for it originated out of a civilian in . <end>
<unchecked> <start> nose basis is rapidly i viv , a sunken civilisation . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A certain Catholicism of sentiment , and a delight in some ancient indigenous so called national existence , or nuisance , are its pre requisites . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Wagner s appropriation of old legends and songs in which learned prejudice had taught us to see something Germanic par excellence we laugh at that now , and the new inspiration of these Scandinavian monsters with a thirst for ecstatic sensuality and : all this taking and giving of Wagner in respect to materials , characters , passions , and nerves , would also express plainly the spirit of Wagner s music , provided that this itself , like all music , should not know how to speak unambiguously of itself : for music is a woman , We must not allow ourselves to be misled with regard to this state of affairs by the fact that for the moment we are living precisely in the reaction within the reaction . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The age of national wars , of ultramontane martyrdom , this whole interlude character which the circumstances of Europe at present are possessed of , may , in fact , assist such art as that of Wagner in obtaining a sudden glory , without thereby guaranteeing to it a future . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The Germans themselves have no future . <end>
<unchecked> <start> WE ANTIPODES It will be remembered perhaps , at least among my friends , that at the commencement I rushed upon this modern world with some errors and overestimates , and in any case as a hopeful person . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I understood who knows from what personal experiences ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> the philo optical pessimism of the nineteenth century as the symptom of a higher thinking power , of a more trim phil fullness of life than had found expression in the philosophy of Hume , Kant , and Hegel , I took tragical perception for the choicest luxury of our civilisation , as its most precious , most noble , most dangerous mode of squandering , but always , on the ground of its super abundance , as its permitted luxury . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I similarly inter pretend Wagner s music in my own way , as the express sion of a Dionysian of soul , I believed that I heard in it the earthquake with which a primitive force of life , suppressed for ages , finally relieves itself , indifferent as to whether all that at present calls itself civilisation is shaken thereby . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is obvious what I misunderstood , it is obvious in like manner what I bestowed icon Wagner and Schopenhauer myself . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Every art , every philosophy may be regarded as a medicine and helping expedient of adv icing or decaying life : they always presuppose suffering and sufferers . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But there are two kinds of sufferers : on the one hand those suffering from the superabundance of life , who want a Dionysian art and similarly a tragic insight and prospect with regard to life , and on the other hand those suffering from the impoverish ment of life , who desire repose , stillness , smooth sea , or else ecstasy , convulsion , intoxication furnished by art and philosophy . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The revenge on life itself the most voluptuous kind of ecstasy for such improver wished ones ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> To the double requirement of the latter Wagner just like Schopenhauer corresponds they both deny life , they it they are thereby my antipodes . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The richest in fullness of life , the Dionysian God and man , may not only allow himself the spectacle of the frightful and the questionable , but even the frightful deed , and every luxury of destruction , de composition and denial , with him the evil , the sense less , and the loathsome appear as it were permitted , as they appear to be permitted in nature as a con sequence of the superabundance of the procreative , restorative powers which out of every desert is still able to create a luxuriant orchard . <end>
<unchecked> <start> On the other hand those suffering most , the poorest in life , would have most need of gentleness , and bene violence that which at present is called humanity in thinking as well as in practice : if possible , a God who is quite specially a God for the sick , a herland similarly also logic , the of existence as a conception , even for idiots the typical freethinkers , like the idealists , and beautiful souls , are all decadent in short , a certain warm , fear excluding narrowness and inclusion in opt mystic horizons which permit stupefaction . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In this manner I gradually learned to understand Epicurus , the antithesis of a Dionysian Greek in like manner the Christian , who , in fact , is only a species of Epicurean who , with the doctrine , belief makes blessed , carries out the principle of Hedonism as far as possible till he is beyond all intellectual righteousness . <end>
<unchecked> <start> If I have something in advance of all psychologists , it is that my insight is sharper for that nicest and most insidious species of inference a posterior in which most errors are made : the inference from the work to its originator , from the deed to the doer , from the ideal to him who needs it , from every mode of thinking and valuing to the ruling requirement behind it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In respect to artists of every kind , I now make use of this main distinction : has the hatred of life , or the superabundance of life become creative here ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> In Goethe , for example , the superabundance became creative , in Flaubert the hatred : Flaubert , a new edition of Pascal , but as an artist with instinctive judgment at bottom : Flaubert est tumours , I lime n est risen , I oeuvre est tout . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He tortured himself when he composed , quite as Pascal tortured himself when he thought they both felt nepotistic . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Unselfishness the de cadence rmc Q , the will to the end in art as well as in morals . <end>
<unchecked> <start> WHERE WAG R Even at the present time France is still the seat of the most intellectual and refined civilisation of Europe , and the high school of taste : but one must know how to find this France of taste . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The Norddeutsche zeitung , for example , or he who has it for his mouthpiece , sees in the French , barbarians , as for me , I seek for the black part of earth , where theft h . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A AT slaves ought to be freed , in the neighbourhood of the Norddeutsche . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He who belongs to that France keeps himself well concealed : there may be a small number in whom it is embodied and lives , be sides perhaps men who do not stand upon the strongest legs , in part fatalistic , melancholy , sick , in part , over refined , such as have the ambition to be artificial but they have in their possession all the elevation and delicacy that is still left in the world . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In this France of intellect , which is also the France of pessimism , Schopenhauer is at present more at home than he ever has been in Germany his principal work twice translated already , the second time admit ably , so that I now prefer to read Schopenhauer in French he was an accident among Germans , as I am an accident the Germans have no fingers for us , they have no fingers at all , they have only claws . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Not to speak of Heinrich Heine I adorable Heine they say in Paris who has long ago passed over into the flesh and blood of the profounder and more soul breathing lyric poets of France . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What would German horned cattle know how to deal with the delicatessen of such a nature ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Finally , as regards Richard Wagner : one would seize it with hands , not perhaps with fists , that Paris is the proper soil for Wagner : the more French music shapes itself according to the needs of the dme moderne , the more it becomes Wagnerian , it already does so sufficiently . <end>
<unchecked> <start> One must not allowNIETZSCHE CONTRA WAGNERone s self to be misled here by Wagner himself it was sheer wickedness of Wagner to mock at Paris in its agony in . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In Germany Wagner is never tieless a mere misunderstanding : who would be more incapable of understanding anything of Wagner than the young Kaiser , for example ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> The fact remains certain , nevertheless , for everyone who is acquainted with the movement of European civilisation , that French Romanticism and Richard Wagner are very closely connected . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Altogether dominated by literature up to their eyes and ears the first artists of Europe possessing a universal literary culture , mostly even themselves writers , poets , intermediaries and blenders of the senses and arts , altogether fanatics of expression , great dis covered in the domain of the sublime , also of the loathsome and the shocking , still greater discoverers in effect , in display , in the art of the shop window , altogether talented far beyond their geniuses , virtuosi through and through with dismal accesses to every thing which seduces , allure , forces , or upsets , born enemies of logic and the straight line , covetous of the foreign , the exotic , the monstrous , and all opiates of the senses and understanding . <end>
<unchecked> <start> On the w r hole , a rashly venturing , magnificently violent , high flying , and high up pulling kind of artists , who had first to teach to their century it is the century of the mass the conception of artist . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But sick . <end>
<unchecked> <start> WAGNER AS THE APOSTLE OF chastity this our mode ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> From German heart came this vexed undulating ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> From German body this self lacerating ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Is ours this priestly hand dilation , This incense fuming excitation ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Is ours this plunging , faltering , wrangling , This , sweet as sugar , ding dong dangling ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> This sly nun ogling , Ave hour bell tinkled , This whole false rapturous flight beyond the heavens this our mode ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Think well ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Ye still stay for impression , For what ye hear is Rome , Rome s faith without Chastity and sensuality are not necessarily anti chemical every true marriage , every genuine love affair is beyond any such antithesis . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But in those cases in which this antithesis really exists , it fortunately needs not at all to be a tragical antithesis . <end>
<unchecked> <start> This might at least be the case with all better constituted , more cheerful mortals , who are not at all disposed , without further ado , to reckon their fluctuating state of equip librium betwixt angel and petite bete among the arguments against existence , the finest , the brightest , such as Hafiz and Goethe , have even discerned an additional charm therein . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is just such contradictions that allure to life . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But if , on the other hand , the ill constituted beasts of Circe can be induced to wor ship chastity , they will , as is but too plain , see and worship in it only their own antithesis and oh , one can imagine with how much tragic grunting and eager ness ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> that same painful and absolutely superfluous antithesis which Richard Wagner at the end of his days undoubtedly intended to set to music and pro duce on the stage . <end>
<unchecked> <start> For what purpose really f we may reasonably ask . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Here , to be sure , that other question cannon be avoided : what had Wagner really to do with that manly alas , so very unmanly rustic simplicity , the poor devil and country lad , Parsifal , whom , by such insidious means , he finally succeeded in making a Roman Catholic what ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> was this Parsifal really meant seriously f For that people have laughed over him I would least of all dispute , nor would Gottfried Keller do so . <end>
<unchecked> <start> One might wish that the Wagnerian Parsifal had been meant to be gay , like a finale or satiric drama , with which , precisely in a due and worthy manner , the tragedian Wagner had intended to take his farewell of us , also of himself , and above all of tragedy , namely , with an excess of the greatest and most wanton parody on the tragical itself , on all the awful earth earnestness and earth of the past , on the stupidest form of the of the ascetic ideal finally surmounted . <end>
<unchecked> <start> For Parsifal is an operetta theme par excellence . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Are we to understand Wagner s Parsifal as his secret laugh of superiority at himself , as the triumph of his greatest , finally attained artistic freedom and artistic other coldness Wagner , who knows how to laugh at himself ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> As has been said , one might wish that it were so : for what sense could we attach to a Parsifal seriously meant ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Is it really necessary to suppose as I have been told that Wagner s Parsifal is the product of a maddened hatred of perception , intellect , and sensuality ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> an anathema on sense and intellect in one breath , in a fit of hatred ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> an apostasy and return to sickly , Christian , and obscurantist ideals ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> And finally , worst of all , the self negation and of an artist who had striven so far , with all his will power , for the opposite , namely , for the highest and sensualist g of his art ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> And not only of his art , but of his life as well . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let us recollect how enthusiastically Wagner once walked in the footsteps of Feuerbach the philosopher . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Feuerbach s phrase of a healthy sensuality , echoed in the third and fourth decades of this century to Wagner as to many other Germans they called themselves the young Germans like the word of salvation . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Did the older Wagner unlearn his former creed ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Very likely he did ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> judging from the disposition he evinced toward the end of his life to his first belief . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Has the hatred of life got the upper hand in him , as in Flaubert ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> For Parsifal is a work of cunning , of , of secret poison brewing , hostile to the pre requisites of life a bad work . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The preaching of chastity is an incitement to : I despise everyone who does not regard Parsifal as an outrage on morals . <end>
<unchecked> <start> HOW I GOT FREE FROM wagner far back as the summer of , in the middle of the period of the first festival plays , my heart had taken farewell of Wagner . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I cannon stand anything ambit gurus and since Wagner s return to Germany , he had condescended step by step to everything that I despise even to Anti feminism . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It was , in fact , high time to take farewell then : soon enough I got proof of that . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Richard Wagner , apparently the most triumphal , while in truth become a decayed , despairing decadent , sank down suddenly , helpless and disjointed , before the Christian cross . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Was there no German then with eyes in his head , or sympathy in his conscience , for this awe inspiring spectacle ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Was I the only one who suffered from it ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Enough , to myself the unexpected event , like a flash of lightning , illuminated the position I had left , and also that subs quest horror which every one feels who has passed unconsciously through a fearful danger . <end>
<unchecked> <start> When I went further on alone , I shivered not long thereafter I was sick , more than sick , namely , fatigued : fatigued by the incessant deceiving concerning all that yet re gained for the inspiration of us modern men , concerning the strength , labour , hope , youth , and love squandered on all sides fatigued out of disgust for the whole ideal stick falsity and softening of conscience , which here once more had scored a victory over one of the bravest fatigued , finally , and not least , by the grief of an relent ing suspicion that I was henceforth condemned to mistrust more profoundly , to despise more profoundly , to be more profoundly alone , than ever before . <end>
<unchecked> <start> For I had had no one but Richard Wagner . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I was condemned perpetually to the Germans . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Lonely , henceforth , and sadly mistrustful of myself , I then , not without indignation , took sides against myself , and for everything which gave pain to , and was hard upon me I thus found the way again to that brave pessimism which is the antithesis of falsity , and also , as it would appear to me , the way to myself , to my task . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That concealed and imperious something for which for a long time we have had no name , until it finally proves itself to be our task , this tyrant in us retaliate frightfully for every attempt which we make to shirk it or escape from it , for every premature decision , for every thinking ourselves equal to those of whose number we are not , for every activity , however honourable it may be , if it happen to distract us from our main business nay even , for every virtue which might shield us from the sternness of our special responsibility . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Sickness is always the answer , when we are inclined to doubt con corning our right to our task , w r hen we begin to make it easier for ourselves in any respect . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Strange and frightful at the same time ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is our alleviation for which we must do the severest penance ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> And if we want afterwards to return to health , there is no choice for us : we must burden ourselves heavier than we were ever burdened before . <end>
<unchecked> <start> THE PSYCHOLOGIST SPEAKSThe more a psychologist , a born , an unavoidable psychologist and soul diviner , turns his attention to the more select cases and individuals , the greater becomes his danger of suffocation by sympathy . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He needs sternness and gaiety more than another man . <end>
<unchecked> <start> For cor eruption , the ruin of higher men , is the rule : it is dreadful to have such a rule always before one s eyes . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The manifold tortures of the psychologist who has once discovered this ruin , and has then in almost every case throughout all history discovered this entire internal blessedness of higher man , this eternal isolate ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> in every sense may perhaps one day become the cause of his own ruin . <end>
<unchecked> <start> One perceives , in almost every psychologist , a tell tale preference for intercourse with common and well ordered men , such as betrays that he always requires curing , that he needs a sort of flight and forgetfulness away from what his insight , his incisions , his business have laid upon his conscience . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He is possessed by a fear of his memory . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He is easily silenced before the judgment of others , he hears with unmoved countenance how others re terence , admire , love , and glorify where he has per received , or he even conceals his silence by expressing his agreement with some superficial opinion . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Perhaps the paradox of his situation gets to be so horrible that the educated classes , on their part , learn great re terence precisely where he has learned great sympathy and great contempt . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And who knows if in all great cases nothing more than this took place , that a God was worshipped , and the God was only a poor sari facial animal . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Success has always been the greatest liar and the work , the deed is a success as well . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The great statesman , the conqueror , the discoverer , are disguised in their creations , hidden away until they are unrecognisable the work of the artist , of the philosopher , only invents him who has created it , is said to have created it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The great men , as they are reverence , are poor little fictions composed after wards , in the world of historical values spurious coinage is current . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Those great poets , for example , such as Byron , russet , Poe , leopard , list , Gogol I do not ven sure to name much greater names , but I think them as they avowedly are and must be , men of the moment , sensuous , absurd , five fold , light minded and hasty in mistrust and in trust with souls in which usually some flaw has to be concealed often taking revenge by their works for an inner contamination , often seeking forgetfulness with their upward flights from a too true memory , idealists out of the neighbourhood of the swamp what torments these great artists are , and the so called higher men generally , for him who has once found them out . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We are all advocates of the mediocre . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is conceivable that it is just from woman who is clairvoyant in the world of suffering , and alas , also , ready to help and save to an extent far beyond her po vers that they experience so easily those outbreaks of unlimited sympathy , which the multitude , above all the reverent multitude , overload with inquisitive and self satisfying interpretations . <end>

<unchecked> <start> THE PROBLEM OF SOCRATESThe wisest men in all ages have judged similarly with regard to life : it is good for nothing . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Always and everywhere we hear the same sound out of their mouth a sound full of doubt , full of melancholy : full of the fatigue of life , full of resistance to life . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Even Socrates said when he died , To live that means to be long sick : I owe a cock to Asclepios the saviour . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Even Socrates had enough of it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What does that prove ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> What does it indicate ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Formerly it would have been said it has been said indeed and loud enough , and loudest of all by our pepsi mists ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Here at all events , there must be some thing true ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> The consensus proves the truth . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Are we still to continue talking in such a manner ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> are we allowed to do so ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Here at all events there must be something diseased , is our answer : those wisest men of all ages , we should look at them close at hand ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Were they , perhaps all of them , a little shaky on their legs ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> lavish ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> tottering ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> decadent ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Does wisdom perhaps appear on earth as a raven inspired by a faint scent of carrion ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> This irreverence , that the great wise men are declining types , first suggested itself to my mind with regard to a case where the strongest prejudices of the learned and the unlearned stood opposed to it : I recognised Socrates and Plato as symptoms of decline , as agencies in Grecian dissolution , as pseudo Grecian , as anti Grecian The Birth of Tragedy . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That consensus I understood it better and better proves least of all that they were correct in that on which they were in accordance : it proves rather that the themselves , those wisest men , w ere somehow in accordance physiologically to take up a position to have to take up a position unanimously negative with regard to life . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Judgments , valuations with regard to life , for or against , can ultimately never be true : they only possess value as smp toms , they only come into consideration as smp toms , in themselves such judgments are follies . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We must by all means stretch out the hand , and attempt to grasp this surprising finesse , that the worth of life cannon be estimated . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It cannon be estimated by a living being , because such a one is a party yea , THE PROBLEM OF SOCRATES ion the very object in the dispute , and not a judge it cannon be estimated by a dead person for a different reason . <end>
<unchecked> <start> For a philosopher to see a problem in the worth of life , is really an objection to him , a mark questioning his wisdom , a folly . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> and all these great wise men they were not only decadent , they were not even wise ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> But I come back to the problem of Socrates . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Socrates , according to his descent , belonged to the lowest of the people Socrates was of the mob . <end>
<unchecked> <start> One knows , one still sees it one s self , how ugly he was . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But ugliness , while it is an objection in itself , is almost a refutation when found among Greeks . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Was Socrates Greek at all ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Ugliness is often enough the expression of a thwarted development checked by cross breeding . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Besides , it appears as deteriorating development . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The anthropologists who are criminologists tell us that the typical criminal is ugly : in f route , monstrous in ammo . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But the criminal is a decadent . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Was Socrates a typical criminal ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> At least the famous verdict of a , which was so offensive to the friends of Socrates , would not contradict that assumption . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A foreigner who was a judge of countenances , when he passed through Athens , told Socrates to his face that he was a most mm he concealed in himself all the worst vices and passions . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And Socrates merely answered , You know me , sir . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I I O THE TWILIGHT OF THE IDOLSNot only does the confessed and anarchy in his instincts point to decadence in Socrates , but the of locality and that rJiacliitical salinity which distinguishes him points in the same direction . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Neither must we forget those auditory hallucinations which have wrongly been interpreted in a religious sense , as the demon of Socrates . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Every thing is exaggerated in him , everything is buff and caricature at the same time everything is concealed , reserved , and subterranean . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I try to understand out of what idiosyncrasy the Socratic equation of reason virtue : happiness originates : that most bizarre of equations , which , in particular , has all the instincts of the older Hellenes opposed to it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> With Socrates Greek taste veers round in fa your of dialectics . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What really happens then ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Above all superior taste is vanquished , the mob gets the upper hand along with dialectics . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Previous to Socrates dialectic manners were repudiated in good society : they were regarded as improper manners , they compromised . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The youths were warned against them . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Besides , all such modes of presenting reasons were distrusted . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Honest things , like honest men , do notte PROBLEM OF SOCRATES I I I carry their reasons in their hands in such fashion . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is indecent to put forth all the five fingers . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That which requires to be proved is little worth . <end>
<unchecked> <start> All the world over , where authority still belongs to good usage , where one does not demonstrate but com hands , the dialectical is a sort of buffoon : he is laughed at , he is not taken seriously . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Socrates was the buffoon who got himself taken seriously . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What really happened then ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> We choose dialectics only when w T e have no other means . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We know we excite mistrust with it , we know it does not carry much conviction . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Nothing is easier wiped away than the effect of a dialectical : that is proved by the experience of every assembly where speeches are made . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It can only be a last defence in the hands of such as have no other weapon left . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is necessary to have to extort one s rights other wise one makes no use of dialectics . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The Jews were therefore Reynard the Fox was a dialect irian : what ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> and Socrates also was one ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Is the irony of Socrates an expression of revolt ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> of a mobile resentment ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Does he , as one of the suppressed , enjoy his natural ferocity in the dagger thrusts of syllogism ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> does he revenge himself on the upper classes whom he fascinates ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> As a dialect irian a person has a merciless instrument in his hand : he can play the tyrant with it he compromises when he conquers . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The dialectical leaves it to his opponent to demonstrate that he is not an idiot he is made furious , and at the same time helpless . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The dialect irian paralyses the intellect of his opponent . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> is dialectics only a form of revenge with Socrates ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> I have given to understand what could make Socrates repellent there is now the more need to explain the fact that he fascinated . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That he discovered a new mode of ago , of which he became the first fencing master for the superior circles of Athens that is one reason . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He fascinated in that he appealed to the atonal impulse of the Hellenes , he introduced a variation into the wrestling matches among young men and youths . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Socrates was also a great erotic . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But Socrates found out somewhat more . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He saw behind the higher class of Athenians , he understood that his case , the idiosyncrasy of his case , was no longer exceptional . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The same kind of degeneration was preparing quietly everywhere : old Athens was coming to an end . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And Socrates understood that all the world had need of him , of his method , his cure , his special artifice for self maintenance . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Everywhere the instincts were in anarchy everywhere people were within an ace of excess : the monstrous in anima was the universal danger . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The impulses are about to play the tyrant , we must invent a stronger than they . <end>
<unchecked> <start> When the physio gnomes had disclosed to Socrates who he was , a cave of all evil passions , the great ironic uttered another word which gives the key to him . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is true , he said , but I became master over them all . <end>
<unchecked> <start> How did Socrates become master over himself ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> His case was after all only the extreme case , the most striking case of that which then began to be the universal trouble namely , that nobody was any longer master of him self , that the instincts became mutually antagonistic . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He fascinated as such an extreme case , his ugliness proclaimed him as such to every eye as a matter of course , he fascinated still more as the answer , the solution , the seeming cure of this case . <end>
<unchecked> <start> When it is necessary to make a tyrant out of reason , as Socrates did , there must be considerable danger of something else playing the tyrant . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Ration laity was hit upon in those days as a Saviour , it was not a matter of free choice for either Socrates or his to be rational , it was de rigueur , it was their last expedient . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The fanaticism with which the whole of Greek thought throws itself upon ration laity betrays a desperate situation : they were in danger , they had only one choice : they had either to go to ruin , or be absurdly rational . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The moralism of Greek philosophers , from Plato downwards , is path logically conditioned their estimation of dialectics likewise . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Reason virtue happiness means merely that we have to imitate Socrates , and put a permanent day light in opposition to the obscure desires the day light of reason . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We have to be rational , clear , and distinct , at any price : every yielding to the instincts , to the unconscious , leads downwards . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I have given to understand by what means Socrates fascinated : he seemed to be a physician , a Saviour . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Is it necessary to expose the error which was involved in his belief in rationality at any price ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is self-deception on the part of philosophers and moralists to think of rising above decadence by waging war with it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Rising above it is beyond their power , what they select as an expedient , as a deliverance , is itself only an expression of decadence they alter its expression , they do not do away with itself . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Socrates was a misunderstanding , the whole of improving morality , including Christian morality , has been a minder standing . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The fiercest day light , rationality at any price , the life clear , cold , prudent , conscious , without instincts , in opposition to instincts : this itself was only an infirmity , another infirmity and , not at all a way of return to virtue , to health , or to happiness . <end>
<unchecked> <start> To have to combat the instincts that is the formula for decadence : as long as life ascends , happiness is identical with instinct . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Has he himself conceived that , this wisest of all self dupes ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Did he say that to himself at the last in the wisdom of his courage to meet death ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Socrates wanted to die : Athens did not give him the poison cup he gave it to himself he compelled Athens to give it to him . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Socrates is no why simian , he said softly to himself : death is the only physician here . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Socrates himself was just a chronic . <end>
<unchecked> <start> REASON IN PHILOSOPHYPeople ask me what is all idiosyncrasy in philo gophers ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> For example , their lack of historical sense , their hatred of the very idea of becoming , their egyptians . <end>
<unchecked> <start> They think they confer honour on a thing when they isolate it from its historical relations , sub specie stern , when they make a mummy out of it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> For millenniums philosophers have been handling conceptual mummies only : nothing real has come out of their hands alive . <end>
<unchecked> <start> They kill , they stuff , when they adore , these gentlemen , the conceptual isolates , they become mortally dangerous to everything when they adore . <end>
<unchecked> <start> For them death , change , and age , just as well as production and growth , are objections , refutations even . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What is , does not become what becomes , is not . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Now they all believe in what is , with desperation even . <end>
<unchecked> <start> As , however , they do not get hold of what is they seek for reasons why it is withheld from them . <end>
<unchecked> <start> There must be a semblance , a deception there , which prevents us perceiving what is : where is the deceiver concealed ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> We have found it , they cry joyfully , it is sensuousness ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Those senses , which are also so immoral in other respects , deceive us with regard to the true world . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Moral : to escape from the deception of the senses , from becoming , from history , from falsehood , history is nothing but belief in the senses , belief in falsehood . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Moral : denial of all that accords belief to the Senses , of all the rest of mankind : that all is mob . <end>
<unchecked> <start> To be a philosopher , to be a mummy , to represent monotony theism by a grave diggers s mimicry ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> And above all , away with the body , that pitiable idea five of the senses ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> afflicted with all the fallacies of logic in existence , refuted , impossible even , although it is impudent enough to pose as actual . <end>
<unchecked> <start> With high reverence I put the name of Heraclfais apart from the others . <end>
<unchecked> <start> If the mob of the other philosophers rejected the testimony of the senses be cause they exhibited plurality and alteration , he re ejected their testimony because they exhibited things as if they possessed permanence and unity . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Heraclitus also did injustice to the senses . <end>
<unchecked> <start> They neither deceive in the way the electrics believed , nor as he believed , they do not deceive at all . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What we make out of their testimony , that is what introduces false hood for example , the falsehood of unity , the false hoods of materiality , of substance , of permanence . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Reason is the cause why we falsify the testimony of the senses . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In as far as the senses exhibit become ing , dissolving , and transforming , they do not de clive . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But Heraclitus will always be right in this that being is an empty fiction . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The seeming world is the only one the true world has been deceitful invented merely . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And what fine instruments for observation we possess in our senses ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> This nose , for example , of which as yet no philosopher has spoken with respect and gratitude , is even in the mean time at least the most delicate instrument at our disposal : it is able to attest minimum differences of movement which even the spectroscope cannon attest . <end>
<unchecked> <start> At present , we possess science exactly to the extent we have resolved to accept the testimony of the senses , to the extent we have learned to sharpen them , furnish them with appliances , and follow them mentally to their limits . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The rest is abortion and not yet science : i . <end>
<unchecked> <start> c . <end>
<unchecked> <start> meta physics , divinity , psychology , and theory of perception . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Or formal science , science of symbols as logic , and that applied form of logic , mathematics . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Actuality is nowhere mentioned in those sciences , not even as a problem as little as the question , what value at all such a symbolic convention as logic possesses . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The other idiosyncrasy of philosophers is not less dangerous : it consists in confounding the last and the first . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The products which occur at the end alas ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> for they should not occur at all ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> the highest notions , that is , the most general , the emptiest notions , the last fume of evaporating reality are placed by them at the beginning , as the beginning . <end>
<unchecked> <start> This , again , is but the expression of their mode of doing reverence : the higher must not grow out of the lower , it must not be grown at all . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Moral : everything of the first rank must be causa sui . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The origin out of something else is regarded as an objection , as a sign of questionable value . <end>
<unchecked> <start> All highest values are of the first rank , none of the highest notions the notions of what is , of the unconditioned , of the true , of the perfect none of all these can have become each must consequently be casa sui . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But none of those highest notions can be unequal either , they cannon be in disagreement among themselves . <end>
<unchecked> <start> They thereby attain their stupendous conception of God . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The last , the thinnest , the emptiest is placed as the first , as cause in itself , as ens . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Alas , have had to take seriously the delirium of sick cobweb spinners ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> And they have paid dearly for it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let us finally state , in opposition thereto , how differently we I say courteously we view the problem of error and . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Formerly , people regarded alteration , mutation , and becoming generally , as evidence of , as indications that there could not but be something there which led them astray . <end>
<unchecked> <start> At present , on the contrary , we see ourselves entangled in some measure in error , necessitated to error precisely as far as our rational prejudice compels us to posit unity , identity , permanence , substance , cause , materiality , what is however certain we are , by means of a strict real creation of the account , that the error is found there . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is just the same here as with the motions of the sun . <end>
<unchecked> <start> There , our eyes are the agencies through which error constantly operates , here it is our language . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In its origin , language belongs to the age of the most rudi century form of psychology : we come into the midst of a gross fetish system when we call up into con seriousness the fundamental presuppositions of linguistic metaphysics i . <end>
<unchecked> <start> e . <end>
<unchecked> <start> the presuppositions of reason . <end>
<unchecked> <start> This system sees everywhere actors and action it believes in will as cause in general it believes in the ego , in the ego as being , in the ego as substance and it projects the belief in the ego substance on to everything it first creates thereby the conception thing . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Being is everywhere thought into , and foisted upon things , as cause it is only from the conception ego that the derivative conception of being follows . <end>
<unchecked> <start> At the commencement there is the great bane of error , that will is something which acts that will is a facility . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We now know that it is merely a word . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Very much later , in a world a thousand times better enlightened , the certainty , the subjective assurance in handling the categories of reason , came , all of a sudden , to the consciousness of philosophers : they concluded that those categories could not have their origin in experience for the whole of experience , they said , was in opposition to them . <end>
<unchecked> <start> consequently , whence do they originate f And in India , as in Greece , the same mistake has been fallen into : we must once have belonged to a higher world instead of one very much lower which would have been the truth ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> we must have been Divine , for we possess reason ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> In fact , nothing has hitherto had a more naive convincing power than the error of being , as it w T as formulated , for example , by the electrics for it has in its favour every word , every sentence which we utter ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> The opponents of the electrics likewise yielded to the misleading influence of their concept of being Democritus among others , when he devised his atom . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Reason in language : oh what a deceitful old female ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> I fear we do not get rid of God , because we still believe in grammar . <end>
<unchecked> <start> People will be thankful if I compress into four theses such an essential and such a new insight . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I thereby make it more easily understood I thereby challenge contradiction . <end>
<unchecked> <start> First Proposition . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The grounds upon which this world has been designated as seeming , rather establish its reality , another kind of reality cannon possibly be established . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Second Proposition . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The characteristics which have been assigned to the true being of things are the characteristics of non being , of nothingness the true world has been built up out of the contra diction to the actual world : a seeming world in fact , in as far as it is merely an illusion of moral optics . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Third Proposition . <end>
<unchecked> <start> To fable about another world than this has no meaning at all , unless an instinct of , disparagement , and aspersions of life is powerful in us : if that be the case we take revenge on life , with the phantasmagoria of another , a better life . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Fourth Proposition . <end>
<unchecked> <start> To separate existence into a true and a seeming world , either in the manner of Christianity , or in the manner of Kant who was a wily Christian at last , is only a suggestion of decadence , a symptom of deteriorating life . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That the artist values appearance more than reality is no objection against this proposition . <end>
<unchecked> <start> For here appearance means reality once more , only select , strengthened , and cor rested reality . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The tragic artist is no pessimist , he rather says yea , even to all that is questionable and formidable he is Dionysian . <end>
<unchecked> <start> HOW THE TRUE WORLD FINALLY BECAME A FABLE The true world attainable by the wise , the pious , and the virtuous man , he lives in it , he em bodies it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Oldest form of the idea , relatively rational , simple , and convincing . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Transcription of the proposition , I , Plato , am the truth . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The true world unattainable at present , but pro mixed to the rise , the pious , and the virtuous man to the sinner who repents . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Progress of the idea : it becomes more refined , more insidious , more incomprehensible , it be comes feminine , it becomes Christian . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The true world unattainable , demonstrable , and unable to be promised but even as conceived , a comfort , an obligation , and an imperative . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The old sun still , but shining only through mist and scepticism the idea become sublime , pale , northerly , Kcenigsbergian . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The true world unattainable ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> At any rate attained . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And being attained also unknown . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Consequently also neither comforting , saving , nor obligatory : what obligation could anything un known lay upon us ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Grey morning . <end>
<unchecked> <start> First yawning of reason . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Cockcrowing of Positivism . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The true world an idea neither good for any thing , nor even obligatory any longer , an idea become useless and superfluous consequently a refuted idea : let us do away with it ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Full day breakfast return of bon sens and cheerfulness Plato blushing for shame infernal noise of all free intellects . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We ha , ve done away with the true world : what world is left ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> perhaps the seeming ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> But no ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> in doing away with the true , we have also done away with the seeming world ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Noon the moment of the shortest shadow end of the longest error climax of mankind inhibit ZARATHUSTRA . <end>
<unchecked> <start> MORALITY AS ANTI NATURALNESSAll passions have a time when they are fatal only , when , with the weight of their folly , they drag their victim down and they have a later , very much later period , when they wed with spirit , when they are spiritualized . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Formerly , people waged war against passion itself , on account of the folly involved in it , they conspired for its annihilation , all old morality monsters are unanimous on this point : il fact ter les passions . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The most notable formula for that view stands in the New Testament , in the Sermon on the Mount , where , let us say in passing , things are not at all regarded from an elevated point of mew . <end>
<unchecked> <start> For example , it is there said with application to sexual it , if thine eye offend thee , pluck it out . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Fortunately no Christian acts according to this precept . <end>
<unchecked> <start> To annihilate passions and desires merely in order to obviate their folly and its unpleasant results appears to us at present simply as an acute form of folly . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We no longer admire the dentist who pulls out the teeth , that they may no longer cause pain . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It may be acknowledged , on the other hand , with some reason idleness that , on the soil out of which Christianity has grown , the notion of a of passion could not at all be conceived . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The primitive Church , as is well known , battled against the in intelligent in favour of the poor in spirit : how could we expect from it an intelligent var against passion ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> The Church fights against passion w T ith excision in every sense : its practice , its cure is castration . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It never asks , How to spiritualist , beautify , and defy a desire ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> it has , at all times , laid the emphasis of discipline upon extermination of sensuality , of pride , of ambition , of avarice , of revenge . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But to attack the passions at the root means to attack life itself at the root : the praxis of the Church is inimical to life . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The same means , castration , extirpation , is instinct lively chosen in the struggle with a desire by those who are too weak of will and too degenerate to be able to impose due moderation upon themselves those natures , which , to speak with a simile and without a simile , need la trapped , any definitive declaration of hostility , a gap between themselves and a passion . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The radical means are indispensable only to the de generate : weakness of will , or to speak more definitely , the incapability of not reacting in response to a stimulus , is itself merely another form of degeneration . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Radical hostility , deadly hostility against sensuality is always a critical symptom one is thereby justified in making conjectures with regard to the general condition of such an extremist . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Moreover , that hostility , that hatred , only reaches its height when such natures no longer possess sufficient strength for a radical cure , for labouring their devil . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Survey the whole history of priests and philosophers , that of artists also included and you will see : the most virulent attacks on the senses are not made by the impotent , nor by ascetics , but by impossible ascetics , those who would have required ascetic life . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The of sensuousness is called love it is a grand triumph over Christianity . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Our spiritual station of hostility is another triumph . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It consists in profoundly understanding the importance of having enemies : in short , in acting and reasoning the reverse of the former acting and reasoning . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The Church al ways wanted to exterminate its enemies : we , the immorality and Anti Christians , see our advantage in the existence of the Church . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In political matters also hostility has now become more spiritualized , much more prudent , much more critical , much more forbearing . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Almost every party conceives that it is advantageous for its self maintenance if the opposite party does not lose its power the same is true in grand politics . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A new creation especially , e . <end>
<unchecked> <start> g . <end>
<unchecked> <start> the new Empire , has more need of enemies than of friends : it is only in opposition that it feels itself indispensable , that it becomes indispensable . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Not otherwise do we comfort ourselves towards the inner enemy there also we have spiritualized hostility , there also we have understood its worth . <end>
<unchecked> <start> People are productive only at the cost of abounding in they only remain young provided the soul does not relax , does not long after peace . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Nothing has be come more alien to us than the desirability of former times , that of peace of soul , Christian desirability nothing makes us less envious than the moral cow and the plump of good conscience . <end>
<unchecked> <start> One has renounced grand life , when one has re bounced war . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In many cases , to be sure , peace of soul is merely a misunderstanding something different , which does not just know how to name itself more honestly . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Without circumlocution and prejudice let us take a few cases . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Peace of soul may , for example , be the mild radiation of a rich animality into the moral or religious domain . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Or the beginning of fatigue , the first shadow which the even ing every sort of evening casts . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Or a sign that the air is moist , that southern winds arrive . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Or un conscious gratitude for a good digestion occasionally called . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Or the quitting down of the convalescent to whom all things have a new taste and who is waiting in expectancy . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Or the condition which follows upon a full gratification of our ruling passion , the agreeable feeling of a rare satiety . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Or the senile weakness of our will , of our desires , of our vices . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Or laziness , persuaded by conceit to deck itself out in moral guise . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Or the attainment of a certainty , even a dreadful certainty , after long suspense and torture through uncertainty . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Or the expression of proficiency and mastery in doing , creating , effecting , and willing , tranquil breathing , attained freedom of will . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Twilight of the Idols : who knows ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> per has also just a modification of peace of soul . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I formulate a principle . <end>
<unchecked> <start> All naturalism in morality , i . <end>
<unchecked> <start> e . <end>
<unchecked> <start> all healthy morality , is ruled by an instinct of life , some command of life is fulfilled by adopting a certain canon of thou shalt and thou shalt not , some hindrance and inimical agency on the way of life is thereby removed . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Anti natural morality , on the other hand i . <end>
<unchecked> <start> e . <end>
<unchecked> <start> almost every morality which has hitherto been taught , reverence , and preached , directs itself straight against the instincts of life , it condemns those instincts , sometimes secretly , at other times loudly and insolently . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Saying that God looks on the heart , it negatives the lowest and the highest vital desiring , and takes God as the enemy of life . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The saint in whom God finds his highest satisfaction is the ideal castrate . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Life is at an end where the King dom of God begins . <end>
<unchecked> <start> If the wickedness of such a mutiny against life as has become almost sacrosanct in Christian morality has been understood , something else has , fortunately , been understood besides : the uselessness , the unreality , the absurdity , and the deceitfulness of such a mutiny . <end>
<unchecked> <start> For a condemnation of life on the part of a living being is ultimately just the symptom of a certain kind of life : the question whether rightly or wrongly is not at all raised thereby . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We would have to have a position outside of life , and yet have to know it as well as each and all who have lived it , to be authorised to touch on the problem of the worth of life at all : sufficient reason to convince us that for us the problem is inaccessible . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Speaking of values , we speak under the influence of the inspiration and the optics of life : life itself compels us to fix values life itself values through us , when we fix values . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It follows therefrom that even that anti naturalness in moral it which takes God as the counter principle and condemnation of life is but an evaluation of life , of which life ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> of which kind of life ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> But I have al ready given the answer : of declining , weakened , fatigued , condemned life . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Morality , as it has hitherto been under stood as it was his formulated by Schopenhauer as denial of will to life is the actual decadence in stint which makes out of itself an imperative : it says , Perish ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> it is the valuation of the condemned . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let us consider in the last place what naivete it manifests to say , Man ought to be so and so ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Reality exhibits to us an enchanting wealth of types , the luxuriance of a prodigality of forms and trans formations and some paltry hod man of a moralist says with regard to it , to ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> man ought to be different ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> He even knows how man ought to be , this parasite and bigot : he paints himself on the wall and says , recce jomo . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But even if the moralist directs himself merely to the individual and says , You ought to be so and so , he still continues to make him self ridiculous . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The individual , in his antecedents and in his consequent , is a piece of fate , an additional law , an additional necessity for all that now takes place and will take place in the future . <end>
<unchecked> <start> To say to him , Alter thyself , is to require everything to alter itself , even backward also . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And in reality there have been consistent moralists they wanted man to be other wise , namely , virtuous they wanted him fashioned in their likeness , as a bigot : For that purpose they denied the world . <end>
<unchecked> <start> No insignificant madness ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> No modest form of presumption ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Morality , in as far as it condemns in itself , and not from regards , considerations , or purposes of life , is a specific error with which we must have no sympathy , it is a de generate idiosyncrasy which has caused an unutterable amount of harm ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> We others , we immorality , on the contrary , have opened our hearts for the recap tion , of every kind of intelligence , conception , and ap probation . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We do not readily deny , we glory in being affirmative . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Our eyes have always opened more and more for that economy which still uses and knows how to use for its advantage all that is rejected by the holy delirium of the priest , of the diseased reason of the priest for that economy in the law of life which even derives advantage from the offensive species of bigots , priests , and the virtuous , what advantage ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> But we immorality ourselves are the answer . <end>
<unchecked> <start> THE FOUR GREAT ERRORSError of confounding cause and effect . <end>
<unchecked> <start> There is no more dangerous error than confounding cone quince with cause : I call it the intrinsic depravity of reason . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Nevertheless , this error belongs to the most ancient and the most modern latitudes of the human race : it is consecrated even among us it bears the names , religion and morality . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is con gained in every proposition which religion and morality formulate : priests , and legislators in morals , are the originators of this depravity of reason . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I take an example : everybody knows the book of the celebrated cornard , in which he recommends his spare diet as a recipe for a long and happy life , for a virtuous life also . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Few books have been read so much even yet many thousand copies of it are annually printed in England . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I believe hardly any book the Bible by right excepted has caused so much harm , has shortened so many lives , as this well meant curiosity . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The source of this mischief is in confounding consequence with cause . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The candid Italian saw in his diet the cause of his long life , while the pre requisite to long life , the extraordinary slowness of the metabolic pro cess , small consumption , was the cause of his spare diet . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He was not at liberty to eat little or much his frugality was not of free will he became sick when he ate more . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He who is not a carp , however , not only does well to eat properly , but is obliged to do so . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A scholar of our day , with his rapid con sumption of nerve force , would kill himself with the regime of cornard . <end>
<unchecked> <start> crude expert . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The most universal formula which lies at the basis of every religious and moral system is , Do so and so , refrain from so and so then you will be happy ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> In case of disobedience . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Every system of morality , every religion is this imperative I call it the great original sin of reason , immortal unreason . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In my mouth , that formula transforms into its inversion the first example of my Transvaluation of all Values : a man well constituted , a fortunate man , has to do certain actions , and instinctively avoids other actions he introduces the arrangement which he represents physiologically into his relations to men and things . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In a formula : his virtue is the result of his good fortune . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Long life and an abundant posterity are not the rewards of virtue : the very slowing of the metabolic process , w r which among other things , has in its train a long life , an abundant posterity , in short , Cornarism is rather virtue itself . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The Church and morality say that a family , a people , is ruined through vice and luxury . <end>
<unchecked> <start> My re established reason says that when a people is perishing , when it degenerates physiologically , vice and luxury follow therefrom i . <end>
<unchecked> <start> e . <end>
<unchecked> <start> the need of continually stronger and more frequent stimulants , such as every exhausted nature is acquainted with . <end>
<unchecked> <start> This young man becomes pale and withered at an early age . <end>
<unchecked> <start> His friends say that this or that sickness is the cause of it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> My opinion is that the fact of his becoming sick , the fact of his inability to withstand the sickness , was from the first the consequence of an impoverished life and hereditary exhaustion . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The newspaper readers say that this party ruins itself by such and such an error . <end>
<unchecked> <start> My higher politics say that a party which commits such errors is at its end its instincts are no longer to be relied upon . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Every error , whatever it may be , is the result of degeneration of instinct , disaggregation of will : we thereby almost define the bad . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Everything good is instinct and consequently , easy , necessary , free . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Trouble is an objection , the God is typically distinguished from the hero in my language : the light feet are the first attribute of Divinity . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Error of false causality . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It was always believed that we knew what a cause was but whence did we derive our knowledge , or , more exactly , our belief that we knew about the matter ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Out of the domain of the celebrated inner facts , none of which have hitherto proved themselves actual . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We believed that we ourselves acted causally in the exercise of will we thought there , at least , we had surprised causality in the very act . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In like manner people did not doubt that all the antecedents of an action , its causes , were to be sought in consciousness , and would be reds covered therein , if sought for as motives : for other wise man would not have been free to act , he would not have been answerable for his actions . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Finally , who would have disputed that a thought is caused ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> that the ego causes the thought ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Of those three inner facts by which causality appeared to be guaranteed , the first and most convincing is that of will as a cause the conception of consciousness spirit as cause , and later still that of the ego the subject as cause , are merely posthumous and have originated when causality , derived from will , was established as a given fact as empiricism . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In the meantime we have changed our mind . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We no longer believe a word of it all . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The inner world is full ot phantoms and will o the wisps : will is one of them . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Will no longer moves anything , consequently also it no longer explains anything , it merely accompanies proceedings , it can also be absent . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The so called motive another error . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Merely a surface phenomena on of consciousness , some accompaniment of an act , which conceals the antecedents of an act rather than manifests them . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And above all the ego ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> It has be come a fable , a fiction , a play upon words it has altogether ceased to think , to feel , and to will ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> What follows therefrom ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> There are no spiritual causes at all ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> The whole of the alleged empiricism that seemed to be in their favour has gone to the devil ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> That follows therefrom ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> And we had made a fine abuse of that empiricism : we had created the world on that basis , as a world of causes , as a world of will , as a world of spirit . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The oldest psychology and the longest maintained has here been at work , it has really done nothing else . <end>
<unchecked> <start> According to this psycho log , every occurence w r as an action , every action was the result of a will the w r world , according to it , be came a plurality of acting agents an acting agent a subject was insinuated into every occurrence . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Man has projected outside himself his three inner facts , that in which he believed firmest of all , will , spirit , and the ego , he only derived the conception of being from the conception of the ego , he posited things as existing according to his own likeness , according to his conception of the ego as cause . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What wonder that later on he always just reds covered in things what he had concealed in them ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> The thing itself , we repeat , the conception of a thing a reflection merely of the belief in the ego as a cause . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And even your atom , Messrs , the mechanisms and Physicists , how much error , how much rudimentary psychology , yet remains in your atom ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Not to speak of the thing in itself , the horrendous addendum of metaphysician ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> The error of spirit as a cause , confounded with reality ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> And made the measure of reality ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> And called God ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Error of imaginary causes . <end>
<unchecked> <start> To start from the dream . <end>
<unchecked> <start> For a definite sensation resulting , for example , from the distant shot of a cannon , there is a cause subsequently foisted on often quite a little romance in which the dreamer himself is the hero . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The sensation , in the meantime , persists as a sort of resonance it waits , as it were , until the causal impulse permits it to move into the foreground of consciousness now no longer as a fortuitous incident , but as meaning . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The cannon shot appears in a causal connection , with a seeming inversion of time . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The later , the motivation , is first realised , often with a hundred details which pass like lightning the shot follows . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What has happened ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> The ideas generated by a certain bodily state were mistaken for its cause . <end>
<unchecked> <start> As a matter of fact , we do just the same when we are awake . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Most of our general sensations every sort of check , pressure , tension , or explosion in the play and counter play of organs , especially the condition of the nervous sympathies excite our causal impulse we want a reason for feeling so and so , for feeling ill or well . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It never suffices us merely to establish the fact that we feel so and so : we only acknowledge this fact we only become conscious of it when we have furnished it with some kind of motif nation . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The recollection , which in such cases becomes active without our being aware of it , calls up earlier conditions of the same kind , and the causal inter relations associated with them , not their causality . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The belief that the associated ideas , the accompanying proceedings of consciousness , have been the causes , is also , to be sure , called up by recollection . <end>
<unchecked> <start> There thus originates an habituation to a fixed causal inter predation , which , in truth , checks the investigation of causes , and even excludes it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Psychological explanation . <end>
<unchecked> <start> To trace back some thing unknown to something known , relieves , quiet , and satisfies , besides giving a sensation of power . <end>
<unchecked> <start> There is danger , disquiet , and solicitude associated with the unknown , the primary instinct aims at doing away with these painful conditions . <end>
<unchecked> <start> First pain simple : any explanation whatsoever is better than none . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Since , after all , it is only a question of wanting to get rid of depressing ideas , people are not specially care ful about the means for getting rid of them : the first conception , by which the unknown declares itself to be something known , is so pleasing that it is taken as true . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Proof of desire power as criterion of truth . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The causal impulse is thus conditioned and excited by the feeling of terror . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The why is intended , if possible , not so much for furnishing the cause on its own account , as for furnishing a species of cause a quitting , liberating , alleviating cause . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The first result of this need is that something already known , something experienced , something inscribed in the memory , is assigned as cause . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The new , the un experienced , the strange are excluded from being a cause . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Thus there is not only a mode of explanation sought for as cause , but a select and privileged mode of explanation that by means of which the feeling of the strange , the new , and the inexperienced , has been most quickly and most frequently got rid of , the most common explanations . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Result : a particular mode of assigning causes more and more , con centres itself into a system , and finally becomes predominant , i . <end>
<unchecked> <start> e . <end>
<unchecked> <start> simply excluding other causes and explanations . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The banker immediately thinks of busi ness , the Christian of sin , and the girl of her love . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The whole domain of morality and religion comes under this conception of imaginary causes . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Ex planation of unpleasant general feelings : They are determined by beings hostile to us evil spirits : the most striking case mistaking hysterics for witches . <end>
<unchecked> <start> They are determined by conduct not to be approved of the feeling of sin , of sinfulness , foisted on to a physiological unpleasantness one always finds rea sons for being discontented with one s self . <end>
<unchecked> <start> They are determined as punishments , as a recital for something we should not have done , for being otherwise than we ought to be audaciously generalised by Schopenhauer into a thesis in which morality appears undisguised , as the actual poisoner and of life : every sore pain , whether bodily or mental , indicates what we deserve , for it could not come upon us , unless we deserved it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Welt als Wille und Vorstellung , They are determined as consequences of inconsiderate actions , which turn out badly the emotions , the senses , assigned as cause , as guilty states of physio logical trouble explained as deserved by means of other states of trouble . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Explanations of pleasant general feelings : They are determined by trust in God . <end>
<unchecked> <start> They are determined by the consciousness of good conduct so called good conscience , a why biological condition sometimes so like a g good di question as to be mistaken for it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> They are determined by the successful issue of undertakings a naive fallacy : the successful issue of an undertaking does not at all produce any pleasant general feelings in a hypo , or in a Pascal . <end>
<unchecked> <start> They are determined by faith , hope , and love the Christian virtues . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In fact , all these presumed explanations are resulting con editions , and as it were translations of pleasant and unpleasant feelings into a false dialect : we are in a condition to be hopeful , because our fundamental physiological feeling is again strong and rich we trust in God , because the feeling of fullness and of strength gives us peace . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Morality and religion be long entirely to the Psychology of Error : in every individual case cause and consequence are confounded or truth is confounded with the result of what is believed to be true or a condition of consciousness is confounded with the causation of this condition . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Error of free will . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Now we have no longer sum path with the notion of free will : we know only too well what it is the most disreputable of all theological devices for the purpose of making men responsible in their sense of the word , that is , for the purpose of making them dependent on theologians . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Here , I only give the psychology of the process of making men responsible . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Wherever responsibility is sought after , it is usually the instinct prompting to punish and condemn which seeks after it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Becoming has been divested of its innocence when any mode of being whatsoever is traced back to will , to purposes , or acts of responsibility : the dogma of will has principally been invented for the purpose of punish ment , i . <end>
<unchecked> <start> e . <end>
<unchecked> <start> with the intention of finding guilty . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The whole of old psychology , will psychology , would have been impossible but for the fact that its origin actors the priests at the head of the old com wanted to create for themselves a right to impose punishment or a right for God to do so . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Men were imagined to be free , in order that they might be condemned and punished , in order that they might become guilty : consequently every activity had to be thought of as voluntary , the origin of every activity had to be thought of as residing in conscious ness whereby the most absolute false coinage in psychologies was made a principle of psychology it self . <end>
<unchecked> <start> now when we have entered upon a move ment in the opposite direction , when we immorality especially endeavour with all our power to remove out of the world the notions of guilt and punishment , and seek to cleanse psychology , history , nature , social institutions and sanctions from these notions , there is not in our eyes any more fundamental antagonism than that of theologians , who , with the notion of a moral order of the world , go on tainting the innocence of becoming with punishment and guilt . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Christianity is the hangman s metaphysics . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What alone can our teaching be ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> That no one gives a man his qualities , neither God , nor society , nor his parents and ancestors , nor he himself the latter absurd idea here put aside has been taught as intel bible freedom by Kant , perhaps also by Plato . <end>
<unchecked> <start> No one is responsible for existing at all , for being formed so and so , for being placed under those cir substances and in this environment . <end>
<unchecked> <start> His own destiny cannon be disentangled from the destiny of all else in past and future . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He is not the result of a special purpose , a will , or an aim , the attempt is not here made to reach an ideal of man , an ideal of happiness , or an ideal of morality it is absurd to try to shunt off man s nature towards some goal . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We have invented the notion of a goal : in reality a goal is lacking . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We are necks say , we are part of destiny , we belong to the whole , we exist in the whole , there is nothing which could judge , measure , compare , or condemn our being , for that would be to judge , measure , compare , and condemn the whole . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But there is nothing outside of the whole This only is the : that no one be made responsible any longer , that the mode of being be not traced back to a causa prima , that the world be not regarded as a unity , either as tentorium or as spirit it is only thereby that the innocence of becoming is again restored . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The concept of God has hitherto been the greatest objection to existence . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We deny God , we deny responsibility by denying God : it is only thereby that we save the world . <end>
<unchecked> <start> THE IMPROVERS OF mankind is known what I require of philosophers namely , to take up their position beyond good and evil , to be superior to the illusion of moral sentiment . <end>
<unchecked> <start> This requirement follows from a principle which I form later for the first time , namely , that there is no such thing as a moral fact . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Moral sentiment has this in common with religious sentiment : it believes in realities which do not exist . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Morality is only an interpretation of certain phenomena , or , more definitely , a interpretation of them . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Moral sentiment belongs , like religious sentiment , to a stage of ignorance in which the very notion of the real , the distinction between the real and the imaginary , is yet lacking : accordingly , at such a stage of intellectual develop ment , truth designates nothing but what we at present call fancies . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In so far the moral sentiment is never to be taken literally : as such it contains nothing but absurdity . <end>
<unchecked> <start> As semiotic , however , its worth remains inestimable : it reveals , at least to the initiated , the most important realities of civilisations and internal operations which did not know sufficient to under stand themselves . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Morality is merely sign language , merely symptomatology one has to know beforehand what it deals with , in order to derive advantage from it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A first example , and quite preliminary . <end>
<unchecked> <start> At all times efforts have been made to improve human beings : it is that above all things which has been termed morality . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The most different tendencies , however , are concealed under the same name . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The taming of animal man , as w ell as the breeding of a particular species of human beings , has been called improving only these zoological termini express realities , realities , indeed , of which the typical improver , the priest , knows nothing does not want to know any thing . <end>
<unchecked> <start> To call the taming of an animal the improv ing of it , sounds almost like a joke to our ears . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Anybody who knows what goes on in menagerie will be doubtful about the improving of animals there . <end>
<unchecked> <start> They are weakened , they are made less mischievous , they become sick by the depressing emotion of fear , by pain , wounds , and hunger . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is precisely the same with tamed man whom the priest has improved . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In the early Middle Ages , when in fact the Church was a menagerie more than anything else , the finest specimens of the blond beast were everywhere pursued the distinguished germanic for example were improved . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Afterwards , however , how did such a Germanic look when improved , when seduced into the monastery ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Like a caricature of man , like an ab option : he had become a sinner , he stuck fast in the cage , he had got shut up in the midst of no thing but frightful notions . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And now he lay there , sick , miserable , ill disposed towards himself full of hatred against the vital instincts , full of suspicion with regard to everything still strong and happy . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In short , a Christian . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Physiologically explained : in combat with the animal , the only means for making it weak can be to sicken it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The Church understood this : it ruined man , it weakened him , but it claimed to have improved him . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let us take the other case of so called morality , the case of breeding a distinct race and species . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Ind ian morality , sanctioned into a religion as the Law of Manu , furnishes the grandest example . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The task is here set to breed no fewer than four races all at once : a priestly race , a warrior race , a trading and ari cultural race , and , finally , a menial race , the sudan . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Here we are obviously no longer among the tamers of animals a race of men a hundred times milder and more reasonable is presupposed , even to conceive the plan of such a system of breeding . <end>
<unchecked> <start> One recovers breath on stepping into this healthier , higher , and wider world out of the sickroom air and prison air of Christianity . <end>
<unchecked> <start> How paltry is the New Testament in comparison with Manu , what a bad odour it has ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> But that organisation also required to be formidable , not , this time , in combat with the beast , but with its own antithesis , the non caste man , the mishmash man , the chantal . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And again it had no other ex pediment for making him harmless , for making him weak , except making him sick , it was the struggle with the great number . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Perhaps there is nothing more repugnant to our feelings than tawse preach binary measures of Indian morality . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The third edict for example adana astra I . <end>
<unchecked> <start> concerning unclean potherbs , ordain that the sole food allowed to the Chandalas shall be garlic and onions , considering that the holy writings forbid giving them grain , fruits , water and fire . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The same edict ordain that the water they require must neither be taken out of rivers , springs , or ponds , but only out of the entrances to swamps , and out of holes made by the footsteps of animals . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In the same manner they are forbidden both to wash their clothes and to wash themselves , since the water , which is conceded to them as a favour , must only be used to quench their thirst . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Finally , there is a prohibition forbidding the supra women to assist the chantal women at child birth , in like manner also a prohibition forbidding the latter to assist one another on such occasions . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The result of such sanitary regulations did not fail to appear : deadly epidemics , frightful sexual diseases , and , in consequence thereof , the law of the knife once more , which ordained circumcision for the male child ren and the removal of the labia minor a in the females . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Manu himself says : The Chandalas are the fruit of adultery , incest , and crime this is the necessary consequence of the concept of breeding . <end>
<unchecked> <start> They shall only have the rags of corpses for clothing , for vessels they shall only have broken pottery , for ornaments old iron , for the worship of God only the evil spirits they shall wander from place to place without repose . <end>
<unchecked> <start> They are forbidden to write from left to right , or to use the right hand in writing : the use of the right hand and from left to right are reserved exclusively for the vir tous , for persons of race These enactments are sufficiently instructive : here for once we have Aryan humanity , perfectly pure , per factly original , we learn that the idea of pure blood is the contrary of a harmless idea . <end>
<unchecked> <start> On the other hand , it becomes manifest in which nation the hatred , the chantal hatred against this humanity , has im formalised itself , where it has become religion , and genius . <end>
<unchecked> <start> From this point of view the Gospels are documents of the first importance , and the book of Enoch even more so . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Christianity springing out of a Jewish root , and only comprehensible as a growth of this soil , represents the movement counter to every morality of breeding , of race , and of privilege : it is anti Aryan religion par excellence : Christianity , the of all Aryan values , the triumph of chantal values , the gospel preached to the poor and lowly , the collective insurrection against race of all the down trodden , the wretched , the ill conti tuned , the misfortune , undying chantal revenge as religion of love . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The morality of breeding and the morality of taming are perfectly worthy of one another as regards the expedients for achieving their ends : we may lay it down as our highest proposition , that in order to create morality , it is necessary to have the absolute will to the contrary . <end>
<unchecked> <start> This is the great , the unearthly problem which I have longest applied myself to : the psychology of the improvers of mankind . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A small and modest matter after all , so called pia fraud , gave me the first access to this problem : fia fraud , the heritage of all philosophers and priests who have improved mankind . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Neither Manu , nor Plato , nor Confucius , nor the Jewish and Christian teachers , have ever doubted of their right to use falsehood . <end>
<unchecked> <start> They have not doubted with regard to quite other rights . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Expressed in a formula one might say that all the measures hitherto used for the purpose of moralising mankind , have been fundamentally immoral . <end>
<unchecked> <start> WHAT THE GERMANS LACKAmong Germans at present , it is not sufficient to have esprit one must appropriate it practically , one must presume to have it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Perhaps I know the Germans , perhaps I may even say a few truths to them . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Modern Germany exhibits a great amount of hereditary and indoctrinated cap city , so that it can even spend prodigal for a while its accumulated treasure of force . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is not a high civilisation that has here gained the ascendency , still less a delicate taste , or a superior beauty of the instincts , but earlier virtues than any other country in Europe can exhibit . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Much good humour and self-respect , much firmness in dealing with one another , in reciprocity of obligations , much , much endurance , and a hereditary moderation which re squires the goad rather than the brake . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I also add that here there is still obedience , without its being humiliating . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And nobody despises his opponent . <end>
<unchecked> <start> WHAT THE GERMANS lack is obviously my wish to be just to the Germans : I should not like to be unfaithful to myself in this matter , consequently I have to tell them what I ob jet to . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It costs dear to attain to power : power stupefied . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The Germans they were once called the nation of thinkers do they really at present think at all ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> The Germans are bored with intellect now days , they mistrust it , politics swallow up all serious ness for really intellectual matters , Deutschland , Deutschland bcr allen , I fear that has been the end of German philosophy . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Are there German philosophers ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> are there German poets ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> are there good German books ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> people ask me abroad : I blush but with the courage which is peculiar to me even in desperate cases , I answer , Yes , Bismarck ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Could I even dare to confess what books people read now days ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Accursed instinct of mediocrity ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Who has not had melancholy reflections con corning the possibilities of German esprit ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> But this nation has arbitrarily stupefied itself for nearly a thou sand years : nowhere have the two great European narcotics , alcohol and Christianity , been more wickedly misused . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Recently , a third has been introduced , with which alone every refined and bold activity of intellectual be wiped out music , our constipated , constipation German music . <end>
<unchecked> <start> How much moody heaviness , lame ness , humidity , and dressing gown mood , how r much beer is in German intelligence ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> How is it really possible that young men , who consecrate their existence to the most intellectual ends , do not feel in themselves the first instinct of intellectuality , the self preservative instinct of intellect and drink beer ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> The alcohol ism of the learned youth is perhaps no interrogative sign with reference to their one can be very learned even without esprit , but in every other respect it remains a problem . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Where do we not find it , the mild intellectual degeneration caused by beer ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> I once laid my finger on an instance of such edge negation , a case almost become celebrated that of our first German freethinkers , the shrewd David Strauss , who degenerated into an author of a drinking saloon gospel and a New Belief . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Not with impunity had he made his vow in verses to the lovely brunette loyalty to death . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I spoke of German esprit to the effect that it becomes coarser and shallower . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Is that enough ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> In reality , it is something quite different which frightensBeer . <end>
<unchecked> <start> me German seriousness , German profundity , and Ger man passion in intellectual matters , are more and more on the decline . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Pathos has altered , not merely intellect quality . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I come in contact now and then with German universities : what an atmosphere prevails among their scholars , what withered , contented , and lukewarm in intellectuality ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> It would be a great misunderstanding if a person should adduce German science by way of objection to me , and , besides , it would be a proof that he had not read a word of my writings . <end>
<unchecked> <start> For seventeen years I have not tired of showing the in intellectually generating influence of our modern scientific pursuits . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The severe heroism to which the immense extent of the sciences at present condemns every in dividal , is a principal reason why the more fully , more richly , and more profoundly endowed natures no longer find suitable education and suitable educators . <end>
<unchecked> <start> There is nothing from which our civilisation suffers more than from the superfluity of presumptuous hod men and fragmental humanities our universities are , against their will , the real forcing houses for this mode of stunted growth of intellectual instincts . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And all Europe has already an idea of it grand politics deceive no body . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Germany is more and more regarded as the flat land of Europe . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I still seek for a German with whom might be serious in my own way , how much more for one with whom I could be cheerful ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Twilight of the Idols : ah ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> who can conceive at present from Ji at seriousness a philosopher here recruits him self ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Our cheerfulness is what is least understood . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let us make an estimate . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is not only manifest that German civilisation declines , there is also sufficient reason for it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> No one can ultimately spend more than he possesses : that is true of individuals , it is true also of nations . <end>
<unchecked> <start> If we expend our means on power , grand politics , economy , international commerce , par , or military interests , if we give away the quantity of understanding , seriousness , will , and self overcoming , which constitutes us , on this side , it is lacking on the other . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Civilisation and the state let us not delude ourselves with regard to the antagonists : civilised state is merely a modern idea . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The one lives on the other , the one nourishes at the expense of the other . <end>
<unchecked> <start> All great periods of civilisation are periods of political decadence : whatever has been great as regards civilisation , has been non-political , even anti political . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Goethe s heart opened on the phenomenon of Napoleon , it closed on the War of Liberation . <end>
<unchecked> <start> At the same time that Germany comes forward as a great power , France acquires a changed importance as a power of civilisation . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Much new intellectual seriousness and passion is already transferred to Paris the question of pessimism , for example the question of Wagner , and almost all psychological and artistic questions are there discussed in an incomparably more refined and more thorough manner than in Germany , the Germans themselves are incapacitated for that kind of seriousness . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In the history of European civilisation there is one thing especially which the rise of the Empire indicates : a displacement of the centre of gravity . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Everybody is aware of it already : in the most important matter and that is civilisation the Germans are no longer of any account . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is asked : have you even a single intellect to point to that counts in Europe , as your Goethe , your Hegel , your Heinrich Heine , and your Schopenhauer counted ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> There is no end of astonish ment that there is no longer a single German philo soper . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In all higher education in Germany , the main thing has been lost : the end , as well as the means for reaching it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That education , culture , itself , is the end and not the Empire that for this end there is need of educators not public school teachers and university scholars : that has been forgotten . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Educators are necessary , who are themselves educated superior , noble intellects , who are proved every moment , who are proved whether they speak or are silent , mature and sweetened civilisations , not the learned lubbers which the public schools and universities at present offer to the youths as higher nurses . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The educators arc lacking save the exceptions of except tons the primary pre requisite of education : hence the decadence of German civilisation . <end>
<unchecked> <start> One of those rarest exceptions is my worthy friend , Jacob Burckhardt of Bale : it is to him , above all , that Bale owes its pre eminence in Humanity . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What the higher schools of Germany actually realise , is a brutal training in order that , with the least possible loss of time , an immense number of young men may be fitted to be used , used lp , as government officials . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Higher education and immense numbers that is a contradiction in principle . <end>
<unchecked> <start> All higher education belongs to the exceptions only : one has to be privileged to have a right to so high a privilege . <end>
<unchecked> <start> All that is great , all that is fine , can never be a common possession : fulcrum est homing . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What determines the decadence of German civilisation ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> That higher education is no longer a privilege democratise of universal , communist culture . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Not to forget that military privileges compel the too great attendance at the higher schools , which means their ruin . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In the Germany of to day no one is any longer at liberty to give his children a noble education : our higher schools are all of them adapted to the most equivocal mediocrity , as regards their teachers , plans of study , and educational aims . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And everywhere there is an unbecoming haste , as if something were wrong , when the young man of twenty three is not yet finished , does not yet know the answer to the main question : what calling ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> A higher class of men , let it be said , do not like callings , precisely because they know they are called . <end>
<unchecked> <start> They have time , they take their time , they do not at all think about getting finished at thirty years of age a person is a beginner , a child in the sphere of high civilisation . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Our over filled public-school , our overloaded , stupefied public school teachers are a scandal : there may perhaps be motives for de fending this condition of things , as the professors of Heidelberg have done recently , there are no reasons for it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In order not to come short of my special mode which is affirmative , and only deals immediately and involuntarily with contradiction and criticism , I at once state the three tasks for the fulfilment of which educators are required . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The youth have to learn to see , they have to learn to think , they have to learn to speak and write : the object in all three cases is a noble civilisation . <end>
<unchecked> <start> To learn to see to accustom the eye to quietness , to patience , to reserve to postpone judgment , to survey and comprehend each case from all sides . <end>
<unchecked> <start> This is the first preliminary schooling for in intellectuality : not to react immediately upon a timu lus , but to get the checking , the settling instincts in hand . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Learning to see , as I understand it , is almost the same thing as in philosophical language is called strong will : the essential thing there is just not to will , the ability to defer decision . <end>
<unchecked> <start> All , all vulgarity rests on the inability to offer resistance to a stimulus people are obliged to react , they follow every impulse . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In many cases such a compulsion is already , decadence , a symptom of exhaustion , almost all that uphill optical crudeness designates by the word vice , is merely that physiological inability not to . <end>
<unchecked> <start> react . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A practical application of having learned to see : As learners , people will in general have become slow , mistrustful , and reluctant . <end>
<unchecked> <start> With hostile quietude they will let the strange and the new of every description approach at first , they will withdraw their hand , so as not to be touched by it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The being open by all doors , the servile prostration before every insignificant fact , the continuous lurking to put one s self , to throw one s self among other people and other things , in short , vaunted modern objectivity is bad taste , it is ignoble par excellence . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Learning to think : people have no longer any notion of it in our schools . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Even in the universities , even among philosophical scholars themselves , logic begins to die out , alike as a theory , as a practice , and as a profession . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let anyone read German books : there is no longer the remotest recollection that a technique , a plan of instruction , and a will to reach proficiency are required for thinking , that thinking requires to be learned as dancing requires to be learned , as a mode of dancing . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Who among the Germans as yet knows by experience that refined tremor which nimble feet in the field of intellect communicate to all muscles ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> The stiff of intellectual bearing , the clumsy hand in grasping that is German in such a degree that abroad it is altogether con founded with the German nature . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The German has no fingers for nuances . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That the Germans have even endured their philosophers , more especially that most deformed conceptual cripple that has ever existed , the great Kant , gives no small concept of German elegance . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In effect , no form of dancing can be ex clouded from a high class education ability to dance with the feet , with concepts , and with words : have I still to say one must be capable of it with the pen also one must learn to write ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> But at this point I should become a perfect puzzle to German readers . <end>
<unchecked> <start> ROVING EXPEDITIONS OF AN INOPPORTUNE philosophers impracticable . <end>

<unchecked> <start> ronan . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Divinity , or the perversion of reason by original sin Christianity : witness Renan , who , whenever he ventures a more general affirmation or negation , fails to catch the point with painful regularity . <end>
<unchecked> <start> For example , he would like to unite into one la science and la noblesse la science , however , belongs to de democracy that is perfectly obvious . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He desires , with no little ambition , to represent an intellectual aristocratic but at the same time he lies on his knees and not on his knees only before the antithetical doctrine , the des humble . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What is the good of all free-thinking , modernism , giving , and wrecked dexterity , if you continue to be a Christian , a Roman Catholic , and even a priest , in your intestines ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Kenan s ingenuity lies in his seductiveness , just as in the case of the Jesuit and the confessor the broad priestly smirk is not lacking in his intellectuality , like all priests he only becomes dangerous when he loves . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Nobody equals him in his faculty for idolising in a fatally dangerous manner . <end>
<unchecked> <start> This spirit of Renan , a spirit which generates , is an additional calamity for poor , sick , feeble willed France . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Sainte veuve . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Nothing of a man full of petty re sentiment against all masculine intellects . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Wanders about delicate , curious , tired , pumping people , a female after all , with a woman s and a woman s sensuousness . <end>
<unchecked> <start> As a psychologist a genius for inexhaustible rich in expedients for the purpose nobody understands better how to mix poison with praise . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Plebeian in his lowest instincts and allied with the resentment of Rousseau : consequently a romantic cist for Rousseau s instinct grunts and yearns for re venue under all . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A revolutionise , though held tolerably in check by fear . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Ill at ease in presence of everything possessing strength public opinion , the Academy , the Court , and even Port Royal . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Embittered against all greatness in men and things , against all that believes in itself . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Poet enough and half woman enough to be sensible of greatness as a power con finally turning like the celebrated worm , because he continually feels himself trodden upon . <end>
<unchecked> <start> As a critic , without a standard , without firmness , and without backbone , with the tongue of the cosmopolitan libertine in favour of variety , but even without sufficient cour age to confess the libertine . <end>
<unchecked> <start> As an historian , without a philosophy , without the power of philosophic vision , on that account declining the task of passing judgment in all great questions , holding up objectivity as a mask . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He behaves otherwise , however , with regard to all matters where a delicate , worn out taste is the highest tribunal there he really has the courage of himself , pleasure in himself there he is a master . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In some respects a prototype of Baudelaire . <end>

<unchecked> <start> George Eliot . <end>
<unchecked> <start> They have got rid of Christian God , and now , think themselves obliged to cling firmer than ever to Christian morality : that is English con sisterly we shall not lay the blame of it on ethical girls a la Eliot . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In England , for every little manic nation from divinity , people have to re acquire respect ability by becoming moral fanatics in an awe inspiring manner . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That is the penalty they have to pay there . <end>
<unchecked> <start> With us it is different . <end>
<unchecked> <start> When we give up Christian belief , we thereby deprive ourselves of the right to maintain a stand on Christian morality . <end>
<unchecked> <start> This is not at all obvious of itself we have again and again to nine this point clear , in defiance of English shallow pates . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Christianity is a system , a view of things , consistently thought out and complete . <end>
<unchecked> <start> If we break out of it a fundamental idea , the belief in God , we thereby break the whole into pieces : we have no longer anything determined in our grasp . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Christianity presupposes that man does not know , cannon know what is good for him and what is evil he believes in God , who alone knows . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Christian morality is a command , its origin is transcendent , it is beyond all criticism , beyond all right of criticism it has solely truth , if God is truth , it stands or falls with the belief in God . <end>
<unchecked> <start> If in fact the English imagine they know , of their own accord , intuitively what is good and evil , if they consequently imagine they have no more need of Christianity as a guarantee of morality that itself is merely the result of the ascendency of Christian valuation , and an ex expression of its strength and profundity : to such an extent that the origin of English morality has been forgotten : to such an extent that the strictly con national character of its right to existence is no longer perceived . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Morality is not as yet a problem for the English . <end>
<unchecked> <start> George Sand . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I read the first letters d un voyager : like all derived from Rousseau , false , artificial , inflated , exaggerated . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I cannon stand this variegated wall paper style nor the vulgar ambition for generous feelings . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But the worst , surely , is the woman s co query with masculine characteristics , with the manners of ill bred boys . <end>
<unchecked> <start> How cold she must have been withal , this insufferable artist ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> She wound herself up like a timepiece and wrote . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Cold like Hugo , like Balzac , like all romanticism , as soon as they began to write ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> And how self complacently she may then have reposed , this productive writing cow , who , like her master Rousseau himself , had in her something German in the bad sense , and at all events , was only possible owing to the decline of French taste ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> But Renan adores her . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A . <end>
<unchecked> <start> moral for psychologists . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Never to occupy one s self with psychology ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Never to observe for the sake of observing ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> That results in false optics , in squinting , in something forced and exaggerated . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Experiencing , as a desire to experience that does not do . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In experiencing anything , one mist not look towards one s self every look then becomes an evil eye . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A born psychologist is instinctively on his guard against seeing for the sake of seeing the same is true of the born painter . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He never works according to nature , he leaves the sifting and expressing of the case , of nature , or of the experienced , to his instinct , to his camera obscure . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He only becomes conscious of what is general , the conclusion , the result he is unacquainted with that arbitrary abstracting from single cases . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What is the result when people do otherwise ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> for example , when they carry on psychology after the manner of great and small Parisian romanciers ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> That mode of business lies in wait , as it were , for the actual , it brings home a handful of curiosities every even ing . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But let us only see what finally results from it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A pile of dabs , at the best a mosaic , in every case something pieced together , disquieting , loud coloured . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The Gon courts are the worst sinners in this respect they do not put three sentences to gather , w which are not simply painful to the eye , to the psychologist . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Nature , estimated artistically , is no model . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It exaggerates , it distorts , it leaves gaps . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Nature is accident . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Studying according to nature seems to me a bad sign it betrays subjection , weak ness , fatalism this lying in the dust before petits faith is unworthy of a complete artist . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Seeing what is that belongs to another species of intellects , to the anti artistic , to the practical . <end>
<unchecked> <start> One has to know who one is . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A psychology of the artist . <end>
<unchecked> <start> To the existence of art , to the existence of any aesthetic activity or perception whatsoever , a preliminary psychological condition is indispensable , namely , ecstasy . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Ecstasy must first have intensified the sensitiveness of the whole mechanism until this takes place art is not realised . <end>
<unchecked> <start> All kinds of ecstasy , however differently conditioned , possess this power above all the ecstasy of sexual excitement , the oldest and most primitive form of ecstasy . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In like manner the ecstasy which follows in the train of all great desires , of all strong emotions the ecstasy of the feast , of the contest , of a daring deed , of victory , of all extreme agitation the ecstasy of cruelty the ecstasy in destruction the ecstasy under certain meteorological influences for example , spring ecstasy or under the influence of narcotics finally , the ecstasy of will , the ecstasy of an overcharged and surging will . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The essential thing in ecstasy is the feeling of increased power and profusion . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Out of this feeling w T e impart to things , we constrain them to accept something from us , we force them by violence this proceeding is called realising . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let us here free ourselves from a press dice : realising does not consist , as is commonly be lived , in an abstraction or deduction of the insignia cant or the contingent . <end>
<unchecked> <start> An immense forcing omit of principal traits is rather the decisive characteristic , so that the others thereby disappear . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In this condition we enrich everything out of our own profusion what we see , and what we wish for we see enlarged , crowded , strong , and overtaken with power . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He who , in this condition , transforms things till they mirror his power , till they are reflections of his perfection . <end>
<unchecked> <start> This constraint to transform into the perfect is art . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Everything that he is not , less becomes for him a delight in himself in art man enjoys himself as perfection . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It would be allowable to imagine an opposite state of things , a specific anti of instinct a mode of being which would impoverish everything , attenuate everything , make everything consumptive . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In fact , history fur wishes us with abundance of such anti artists , persons with starved lives , who must necessarily lay hold of things , drain them , and make them more emaciated . <end>
<unchecked> <start> This is the case with the genuine Christian , Pascal , for example a Christian , who is at the same time an artist , is not to be found . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let no one be childish enough to refer me to the case of Raphael , or to any homoeopathic Christian of the nineteenth century . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Raphael said yea , he did yea consequently Raphael w as no Christian . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What do the antithetical notions Apollinian and Dionysian which I have introduced into aesthetics imply , when we conceive of them both as modes of ecstasy ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Apollinian ecstasy above all keeps the eye on the alert , so that it acquires the faculty of vision . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The painter , the sculptor , and the epic poet , are visionaries par excellence . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In the Dionysian condition , on the other hand , the entire emotional system is excited , and has its energies augmented so that it discharges itself simultaneously by all channels of expression , and forces the faculties of representation , of imitation , of transfiguration , of metamorphosis all kinds of mimi cry and acting into activity at one and the same time . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The essential thing is the easiness of the meta , the incapacity to resist a stimulus similar to the case of certain hysterical patients , who also act every role at every hint . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is impossible for Dionysian man not to understand any suggestion , he overlooks no symptom of emotion , he possesses the highest manifestation of knowing and divining instinct , as also the highest development of commune active art . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He assumes every external appearance , every emotion he changes himself continually . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Music , as we understand it at present , is also a collective excitement and collective discharge of the emotions , nevertheless it is only the survival of a much wider world of emotional expression , a mere residuum of Dionysian histrionic . <end>
<unchecked> <start> To make music possible as a separate art , several of the senses especially muscular sense have here been eliminated relatively at least , for to a certain extent all rhythm still speaks to our muscles so that man no longer immediately imitates and gives bodily expression to every feeling . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Nevertheless that is the Dionysian normal condition , at any rate the original condition : music is the slowly attained specialisation of this condition at the cost of the faculties nearest akin to it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The actor , the mime , the dancer , the musician , and the lyric poet are fundamentally akin in their instincts and one in their essence , but they have gradually specialised and separated from one another till indeed they are in contradiction . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The lyric poet remained longest united with the musician the actor remained longest connected with the dancer . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The architect re presents neither a Dionysian , nor an Apollinian con edition here it is the great act of will , the will which removes mountains , ecstasy of the strong will that is desirous of art . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The most powerful men have always inspired architects the architect has always been under the suggestion of power . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In the work of architecture pride , triumph over gravity and will to power , are intended to display themselves architecture is a sort of eloquence of power embodied in forms , sometimes persuading , even nattering , and sometimes merely commanding . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The highest feeling of power and security is expressed in that which has the grand style . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Power which needs no further demon station , which scorns to please , which answers un willingly , which has no sense of any witness near it , which is without consciousness that there is opposition to it , which repose in itself , fatalistic , a law among laws : that is what speaks of itself as the grand style . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I read the Life of Thomas Carlyle , that unconscious and unintended farce , that heroic moral interpretation of dyspeptic conditions . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Carlyle , a man of strong words and attitudes , a rhetorician from necessity , who was continually irritated by the longing for a strong belief and the feeling of incapacity for it in that re spect a typical romanticism ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> The longing for a strong belief is not evidence of a strong belief , rather the contrary . <end>
<unchecked> <start> When one has this belief , one may allow one s self the choice luxury of scepticism one is sufficiently sure , sufficiently resolute , and sufficiently bound for doing so . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Carlyle deafen something in his nature by the fortissimo of his reverence for men of strong belief , and by his rage against the less stupid he requires noise . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A constant , passionate insincerity towards himself that is his propria he is interesting , and will remain interesting thereby . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In England , to be sure , he is admired precisely on account of his sincerity . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Well , that is English and in consideration that the English are the people of consummate cant , it is not merely conceivable , but appropriate . <end>
<unchecked> <start> After all , Carlyle is an English atheist , w r ho aspires to honour for not being one . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Euicrsou . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Much more enlightened , more discursive , more varied , more refined than Carlyle , above all more fortunate . <end>
<unchecked> <start> One who instinctively nourishes himself solely with ambrosia , leaving alone what is indigestible in things . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A man of taste in comparison with Carlyle . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Carlyle , who had much love for Emerson , said never tieless , he does not give us enough to chew , which may rightly be said , but not to Emerson s prejudice . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Emerson possesses that kind hearted and ingenious cheerfulness , which discourages all sternness he does not by any means know how old he is already , and how young he wall yet be he could say of himself , with an expression of Lope de Vega : yo me sucked a mi miso . <end>
<unchecked> <start> His mind always finds reasons for being contented , and even grateful and now r and then verges on the cheerful transcendence of that worthy man , who , returning from a love appointment , danquah re line gesta , said thankfully , Ut desist vires , taken est luanda voluntas . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Anti Darwin . <end>
<unchecked> <start> As regards the celebrated struggle for life , it seems to me , in the mean time , to be more asserted than proved . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It occurs , but only as an exception the general aspect of life is not a state of want or hunger it is rather a state of opulence , luxuriance , and even absurd prodigality , where there is a struggle , it is a struggle for power . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We must not confound Malthus with nature . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Granted , however that this struggle exists and in fact it does occur , its results , alas , are the reverse of what the Darwinian school wish , the reverse of what one might perhaps wish , in accordance with them : it is prejudicial to the strong , the privileged , the fortunate exceptions . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The species does not grow in perfection : the weak again and again get the upper hand of the strong , their large number and their greater cunning are the cause of it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Darwin forgot the intellect that was English ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> the weak have more intellect . <end>
<unchecked> <start> One must need intellect in order to acquire it one loses it when it is no longer necessary . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He who has strength rids himself of intellect let it go hence ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> is what An allusion to Luther s song , Eine feste Burg ist under Gott ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> people think in Germany at present , the Empire will remain . <end>
<unchecked> <start> As is obvious , under intellect I comprehend foresight , patience , craft , dissimulation , grand self-control , and all modifications of mimicry . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A great deal of so called virtue is included under mimicry . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Psychologist Casuistry . <end>
<unchecked> <start> This individual is an ex pert in the knowledge of men : for what end is he actually studying men ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> He wants to get some little advantages over them , or even some great advantages , he is a politics . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That individual is also an expert in the knowledge of men , and you say he wants nothing for himself thereby , he is one of the grand impersonal . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Look at him more carefully ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Perhaps he even wants a more reprehensible advani take : to feel himself superior to men , to be allowed to look down on them , not to confound himself with them any longer . <end>
<unchecked> <start> This impersonal one is a despised of men the former is the more humane species , what ever appearance may indicate . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He at least places himself on an equality with men , he places himself among them . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The psychological tact of the Germans seems to me to be called in question by a whole series of cases , a list of which my modesty prevents me from bringing forward . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In one case a remarkable inducement will not be lacking to establish my thesis : I have a grudge against the Germans for having made a mistake about Kant and his back door philosophy , as I call it , that was not the type of intellectual honesty . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That other thing which I do not like to hear is a notorious and : the Germans say Goethe and Schiller I am afraid lest they say Schiller and Goethe : Is this Schiller not yet known ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> There are still worse and I have heard with my own ears , Schopenhauer and Hartmann to be sure , only among university professors . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The most intellectual men , provided they are the most courageous , experience by far the most painful tra geddes but they reverence life just on that account , because it places its most powerful hostile forces in opposition to them . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Intellectual conscience . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Nothing seems to me to be rarer at present than genuine hypocrisy . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I have a strong suspicion that the mild air of our civilisation is not beneficial to this plant . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Hypocrisy belongs to the ages of strong belief when people did not part with their own belief , even under the constraint of showings THE TWILIGHT OF THE IDOLS off another belief . <end>
<unchecked> <start> At present people part with it or , what is more common , they provide themselves with a second belief , in all cases they remain honest . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Undoubtedly , there is at present a very much greater variety of convictions possible than there were for merely : possible , that is to say they are permitted , they do no harm . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Out of this state of things tolerance towards one s self originates . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Tolerance towards one s self permits of se real convictions these live together in agreement , they take care , as everybody does at present , not to compromise themselves . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What does one compromise one s self with at present ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> If one is consistent . <end>
<unchecked> <start> If one goes in a straight line . <end>
<unchecked> <start> If one is less than . <end>
<unchecked> <start> If one is genuine . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I very much fear that modern man is simply too comfortable for some vices so that these die out altogether . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Everything wicked which is determined by strong will perhaps there is nothing wicked without strength of will degenerates to virtue in our lukewarm atmosphere . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The few hypocrites I have become acquainted with imitated hypocrisy they were actors , like almost every tenth man at present . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Beautiful and ugly . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Nothing is more conditioned , let us say more restricted , than our sense of the beautiful . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A person who would try to think of it as detached from the delight of man in man would im immediately lose his footing . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The beautiful in itself is merely an expression , not even a concept . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In the beautiful , man posits himself as the standard of perfection in select cases he worships himself in that standard . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A species cannon possibly do otherwise than thus to say yea to itself . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Its lowest instinct , that of self maintenance and self expansion , still radiates in such . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Man believes the world itself to be overcharged with beauty , he forgets that he is the cause of it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He alone has endowed it with beauty , alas ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> only with very human , all too human beauty . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In reality man mirrors himself in things he counts everything beautiful which reflects his likeness the verdict beautiful is man s conceit of his species . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A little suspicion may in fact whisper the question into a sceptic s ear Is the world really , just because man thinks it is ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Man has humanise it that is all . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But nothing , nothing whatever warrants us in supposing that it is just man who furnishes the model of the beautiful . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Who knows how he appears in the eyes of a higher judge of taste ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Perhaps risky ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> perhaps even entertaining ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> perhaps a little arbitrary ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Oh divine Dionysos , why dost thou pull mine ears ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> asked Ariadne once of her philosophic lover , in one of the celebrated dialogues at Naxos . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I find a sort of humour in thine ears , Ariadne : why are they not longer ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Nothing is beautiful , except man : all aesthetics rest on this naivete , it is their first truth . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let us straightway add the second : nothing is ugly , except degenerating man the domain of aesthetic judge ment is thereby limited . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Re examined physiology cally , all that is ugly weakens and afflicts man . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It reminds him of deterioration , of danger , and of im potency he actually suffers loss of power by it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The effect of ugliness can be measured by the dynamo meter . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Whenever man is depressed he has a sense of the proximity of something ugly . <end>
<unchecked> <start> His sense of power , his will to power , his courage , his pride they decrease with the ugly , they increase with the beautiful . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In both cases we draw an inference , the premises of which are accumulated in enormous fullness in instinct . <end>

<unchecked> <start> Schopenhauer . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Schopenhauer , the last German who comes into consideration who is a European event , like Goethe , like Hegel , like Heinrich Heine , and not merely a local , a national occurrence , is a case of the first rank for a psychologist , as being an ill natured , ingenious attempt to bring into the field , in favour of a general nihilistic valuation of the whole of life , the very opposite instances , the grand self affirmations of will to life , the exuberant forms of life . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He has interpreted in turn art , heroism , genius , beauty , grand sympathy , knowledge , will for truth , and tragedy , as phenomena resulting from negation , or from the need of negation of will , the most spurious psycho logical vintage , Christianity excepted , which history records . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Looked at more closely , he appears therein merely the heir of Christian interpretation : only , he knew how to justify in a Christian sense t . <end>
<unchecked> <start> e . <end>
<unchecked> <start> in a nihilistic sense even the great facts of human civilisation , which had been repudiated by Christianity , interpreting them as ways leading to salvation , as early forms of salvation , as stimulant for making take a single instance . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Schopenhauer speaks of beauty with melancholy ardour : what is his ultimate reason for it ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Because he sees in it a bridge by may get further on , or acquire an incentive to g et further on . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He regards it as a momentary salvation from will it allure to everlasting sal nation . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He especially praises it as the Saviour from the focus of will , from sexuality , in beauty he sees the generative impulse negatived . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Strange saint ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Somebody contradicts thee , I fear it is nature . <end>
<unchecked> <start> For what end at all is there beauty of tone , colour , odour and rhythmical motion in nature ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> What evolves the display of beauty ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Fortunately a philosopher con traits him also : no less an authority than divine Plato Schopenhauer himself calls him divine maintains another thesis : that all beauty incites to procreation , that this is precisely the propria of its operation , from its most sensuous , up to its most intellectual manifestations . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Plato goes further . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He says , with an innocence for which one must be Greek and not Christian , that there would be no Platonic philosophy at all , were there not such handsome youths in Athens it was only the sight of them which put the soul of the philosopher into an erotic ecstasy , and gave it no rest until it had implanted the seed of all high things in such a fine soil . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A strange saint also ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> one does not trust one s ears , even if one trusts Plato . <end>
<unchecked> <start> At least , one surmise that they philosophies differently at Athens , above all that they philosophies publicly . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Nothing is less Grecian than the conceptual of a recluse , amor intellectuals dci , according to the mode of Spinoza . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Philosophy , according to Plato s mode , could rather be defined as an erotic competition , as a further development and an of the old agnostic system of gymnastics , with its pre requisites . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What ultimately grew out of this philosophical erotic of Plato ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> A new technical form of Grecian ago , dialectics . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I further call to mind , in opposition to Schopenhauer and to the honour of Plato , that the whole of the higher civilisation and literature of classical France has also grown up on the soil of sexual interest . <end>
<unchecked> <start> One may search every where in it for gallantry , sensuality , erotic competition , woman , one will never search in vain . <end>
<unchecked> <start> L art pour I art . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The fighting against the end in art is always warfare against the moralising tendency in art , against its subordination to morality . <end>
<unchecked> <start> L art pour I art : that is , the devil take morality . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But this very hostility betrays the domination of the prejudice . <end>
<unchecked> <start> When the end of the ethical preacher and improver of mankind has been excluded from art , it does not at all follow that art in itself is without an end , without a goal , meaningless in short , I art pour I art a serpent which bites its own tail . <end>
<unchecked> <start> No end at all , rather than a moral end ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> thus speaks pure passion . <end>

<unchecked> <start> does it not praise ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> does it not glorify ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> does it not select ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> does it not bring into prominence ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> In each of these cases it strengthens or weakens certain valuations . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Is this only a contingent matter ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> an accident ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> something with which the instinct of the artist would not at all be concerned ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Or rather , is it not the pre requisite which enables the artist to do something ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Is his fundamental instinct directed towards art ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> or is it not rather directed towards the sense of art , namely , life ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> towards a of life ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Art is the great stimulus . <end>
<unchecked> <start> to life , how could art be understood as purposeless , as aimless , as I art four I art f A question still remains : art makes manifest also much that is ugly , harsh , and questionable in life , does it not thereby seem to make life inter able ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> In fact there have been philosophers who gave this meaning to it : Schopenhauer taught that the w hole purpose of art is to disengage from will he honoured it as the great usefulness of tragedy to dispose to resignation . <end>
<unchecked> <start> This however I have already hinted at it is pessimistic optics and the evil eye : one must appeal to artists themselves . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What of his own personality docs the artist communicate to others in tragedy ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is not precisely the fearless state of mind in presence of the frightful and the questionable which he exhibits ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> This state of mind is highly de sizable in itself whoever knows it honours it with the highest regard . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He communicates it , he is obliged to communicate it , provided he is an artist , a genius of communication . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Bravery and self possession in presence of a powerful enemy , an awful calamity , or a problem which awakens dread it is this tri mughal condition which the tragic artist selects and glorifies . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In presence of tragedy the martial spirit in us celebrates its Saturnalia he who is accustomed to affliction , he who seeks affliction heroic man extols his existence with tragedy , to him alone the tragic artist offers the draught of this sweetest cruelty . <end>

<unchecked> <start> ROVING EXPEDITIONS OF AN inopportune PHILOSOPHER I Q the speaks . <end>
<unchecked> <start> There is nothing more distasteful to a philosopher than man in as far as lie wishes . <end>
<unchecked> <start> When the philosopher sees man only in his doings , when he sees this bravest , most artful , and most enduring animal , led astray even into labyrinthine states of trouble , how worthy of admiration does man appear to him ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> The philosopher even furnishes man with encouragement . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But he despises wishing man , desirable man also and in general all desire abilities , all human ideals . <end>
<unchecked> <start> If it were possible , a philo soper would be a nihilist , because he finds nothing ness behind all human ideals . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Or not even nothing ness , but only vileness , absurdity , sickness , cowardice , and fatigue : all sorts of dregs out of the drained goblet of his own life . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Man , who , as a reality , is so worthy of reverence , how is it that he deserves no respect in so far as he manifests his wishes ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Has he to do penance for being so accomplished as a reality ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Has he to compensate for his activity , for the exertion of thought and will in every activity , by the stretching of his limbs in the imaginary and absurd ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> The history of his has hitherto been the partie hortense of man one must be careful not to read too long in it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What justifies man is his reality , it will for ever justify him . <end>
<unchecked> <start> How much more worthy is actual man , compared with any merely wished , dreamt , or shamelessly falsified man ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> compared with any ideal man whatsoever . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is only ideal man that is distasteful to the philosopher . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Natural value of egotism . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Selfishness has as much value as the physiological value of him who possesses it : it may be very valuable , or it may be vile and contemptible . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Each individual may be looked at with respect to whether he represents an ascending or a descending line of life . <end>
<unchecked> <start> When that is deter mined , we have a canon for determining the value of his selfishness . <end>
<unchecked> <start> If he represent the ascent of the line of life , his value is in fact very great and on account of the collective life which in him makes a further step , the concern about his maintenance , about provide ing his optimum of conditions , may even be extreme . <end>
<unchecked> <start> For the single person , the individual , as hitherto understood both popularly and philosophically , is cer mainly an error : he is nothing by himself , no atom , no ring of the chain , nothing merely inherited from former times , he is the embodiment of the one entire line of descent up to himself . <end>
<unchecked> <start> If he represent des sending development , decay , chronic degeneration , or sickening diseases , taken on the whole , are phena mena which result from decay already present , they are not the causes of it , he has little worth , and the greatest fairness would have him take away as little as possible from the well constituted . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He is no more than their parasite then . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Christian and anarchist . <end>
<unchecked> <start> When the anarchist , as the mouth piece of degenerating strata of society , demands justice , righteousness and equal rights with embellished indignation , he is only under the influence of his lack of civilisation , which prevents him understanding why he is actually in trouble , in what respect he is impoverished , that it is in vital vigour that he is impoverished . <end>
<unchecked> <start> An impulse to seek for causes is strong in him : it must be somebody s fault that he is in a bad condition . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Even ember wished indignation itself is pleasant to him it is an enjoyment for every poor devil to vilify , it gives a taste of the ecstasy of power . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Even lamenting and bewailing one s self can give life a charm by which it becomes tolerable . <end>
<unchecked> <start> There is a refined dose of revenge in every lament people reproach those who are different from them for their own bad condition , and under certain circumstances even for their wicked ness , as if it were injustice , as if it involved permitted privilege . <end>
<unchecked> <start> If I be camille , thou shoulds be so also : it is on the basis of such logic that revolt tons arise . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Bewailing one s self never does any good : it originates from weakness . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Whether a person im puts his bad condition to others , or to himself the socialist does the former , and the Christian , for ex ample , does the latter it makes no essential difference . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That which both cases have in common , let us also say that which is unworthy in both cases , is that some body is to be blamed for the suffering in short , that the sufferer prescribes for himself the honey of revenge to alleviate his suffering . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The objects towards which this need of revenge , as a need of enjoyment , is directed are furnished by occasional causes the sufferer finds causes everywhere , which serve to cool his petty revenge , if he is a Christian , we repeat , he finds the causes in himself . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The Christian and the anarchist both are decadent . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But moreover , when the Christian condemns , calumnies and fouls the world , he does it from the same instinctive motive which impels the socialistic working man to condemn , and before society : doomsday even is the delicious com fort of revenge , revolution , the same as the socialistic working man expects , merely conceived as somewhat more remote . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The other world itself what would be the use of it , if it were not a means for fouling this world ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Criticism of decadence morality . <end>
<unchecked> <start> An altruistic morality , a morality which causes selfishness to lan guise , is , under all circumstances , a bad sign . <end>
<unchecked> <start> This is true of the individual , it is especially true of peoples . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The best is wanting , when selfishness begins to be de ancient . <end>
<unchecked> <start> To choose instinctively what is self injurious , to be alluded by disinterested motives , furnishes almost the formula for decadence . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Not to seek one s own advantage : that is merely the moral fig leaf for quite a different thing , for the physiological fact , one does not know any longer how to find one s own advantage . <end>
<unchecked> <start> disaggregation of instincts ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is at an end with him when man becomes altruistic . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Instead of naively saying , am no longer of any account , the moral falsehood in the mouth of the decadent says , nothing is of any account , life is of no account . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Such an opinion is ultimately a great danger it is con various , soon growing up luxuriantly to a tropical vegetation of ideas on the whole morbid soil of society , at one time as a religion Christianity , at another time as a philosophy schopenhauerian . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Under certain circumstances such ups tree vegetation , grown out of corruption , poisons life with its far reaching emanations for millenniums . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Morality for physicians . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The sick are parasites of society . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In certain conditions it is improper to live any longer . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The continued vegetation in cowardly dependence on physicians and prescriptions after demeaning of life , the right to life , has been lost , should entail the profound contempt of society . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The physicians , on the other hand , would have to be agents for com mutilating this contempt , not recipes for their patients , but every day a new dose of aversion from them . <end>
<unchecked> <start> To create a new responsibility , the physician s respond ability , for all cases where the highest interest of life , of ascending life , requires the remorseless crushing down and thrusting aside of degenerating life for example , for the right to procreation , for the right to be born , for the right to live . <end>
<unchecked> <start> To die proudly when it is no longer possible to live proudly Death selected voluntarily , death at the right time , consume mated with brightness and cheerfulness in the midst of children and witnesses : so that an actual leave taking is possible where he is yet present who takes his leave , as also an actual appraisement of what has been realised and aspired after , a summing up of life all in opposition to the pitiable and horrifying comedy which Christianity has practised with the hour of dying . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We must never forgive Christianity for having taken advantage of the weakness of the dying to outrage their consciences , for having misused even the mode of death to arrive at valuations of men and of the past Here , in spite of all cowardice of prejudice , it is primarily a question of re establishing the correct evaluation , t . <end>
<unchecked> <start> e . <end>
<unchecked> <start> physiological evaluation , of so called natural death , which , in the end , is nothing but an unnatural death , a suicide . <end>
<unchecked> <start> One is never destroyed by any one but one s self . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But natural death is a death under the most contemptible conditions , involuntary death , death at the wrong time , a coward s death . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Out of love of life we should desire a different kind of death voluntary , conscious , not accidental or by surprise . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Finally , an advice to Messrs , the pessimists and other decadent . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We have not it at our disposal to prevent being born we can , however , rectify this error for it is sometimes an error . <end>
<unchecked> <start> When some one does away with himself , he does the noblest thing in the world by so doing he has almost entitled himself to live . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Society what am I saying ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> life itself , is more advantaged thereby , than by any life of re enunciation , anaemia , or other virtue , one has freed others from one s presence , one has removed an objection to life . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Pessimism , pur , very , only proves itself by the self refutation of Messrs , the pessimists : one must go a step further with one s logic , and not . <end>
<unchecked> <start> merely negative life with Will and Representation , as Schopenhauer did , one must , in the first place , negative Schopenhauer . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Pessimism , let us say in passing , notwithstanding its , does not on the whole increase the infirmity of an age or race : it is the expression of infirmity . <end>
<unchecked> <start> One succumbs to it as one succumbs to cholera one has to be morbidly enough disposed for it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Pessimism itself does not make a single additional decadent I call to mind the result of the statistics , that the years in which the cholera rages do not differ from the other years in the total number of deaths . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Whether we are become more moral . <end>
<unchecked> <start> As was to be expected , the whole ferocity of moral stupefaction , which avowedly passes for morality itself in Germany , has taken up arms against my conception , beyond good and evil : I could tell fine stories about it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> My critics above all gave me the undeniable superiority of the moral sentiment of our age to reflect upon , the actual progress we have made in this respect in comparison with us , a Caesar Borgia was on no ac count to be set up in my fashion as a higher man , as a kind of beyond man . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A Swiss editor , of the Bund , went so far not without expressing his esteem of the courage for such a jeopardy as to understand the meaning of my work to the effect that I proposed to do away with all decent sentiment . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Very much obliged ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> I permit myself , as an answer , to raise the question , whether we are really become more moral . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That all the world believes it is already an objection against it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We modern men , very delicate , very readily injured , giving and taking consideration in a hundred ways , we conceit ourselves in fact that this delicate humanity which we manifest , this realised unanimity in forbearance , in helpfulness , and in mutual trust is positive progress , and that we are thereby far above the men of the Renaissance . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Every age , however , thinks in this manner , it is obliged to think thus . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is certain we could not place ourselves in Renaissance conditions we could not even conceive ourselves placed in them : our nerves would not stand that reality , not to speak of our muscles . <end>
<unchecked> <start> No progress , however , is demonstrated by this incapacity , but only a different , a later con edition , weaker , tendered , and more readily injured , out of which a considerate morality necessarily evolves . <end>
<unchecked> <start> If we were to think of our tenderness and lateness , our physiological aging , as absent , our womanising morality also would forthwith lose its value no mor laity has value in itself it would even let us despise it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let us not doubt , on the other hand , that we modern men , with our thick added humanity , which will not by any means strike against a stone , would furnish a comedy to the contemporaries of caesar Borgia to laugh themselves to death over . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In fact we are extraordinarily amusing , though involuntarily , with our modern virtues . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The decline of hostile and distrust awakening instincts for that would be our progress represents only one of the cone sequences in the general decline of vitality : it costs a hundred times more pains and more foresight to effectual an existence so conditioned and so late . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Under such circumstances people mutually assist one another to a certain extent everybody is sick , and everybody is a sick nurse . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That condition of things is then denominated virtue : among men who knew a different mode of life , fuller , more prodigal , more profuse , it would have had a different name , perhaps cowardice , , or old woman s morality . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Our softening of manners that is my thesis , it is , if you will , my innovation is a consequence of decadence severity , of manners may , inversely , be a consequence of super abundance of life : for then much can be dared , much can be challenged , and much also can be squandered . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What was formerly a seasoning of life would be poison to us . <end>
<unchecked> <start> To be indifferent that also is a form of strength for that likewise we are too old and too late : our morality of sympathy against which I w r as the first to give warning , that which one might designate as impressionism morale , is a further expression of the physiological over excitability possessed by all that is decadent . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That movement which has attempted to introduce itself scientifically by means of Schopenhauer s morality of sympathy a very unfortunate attempt ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> is the true decadence movement in morals , and , as such , is intrinsically related to Christian morality . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Vigorous eras , noble civilisations , see something contemptible in sympathy , in brotherly love , in the lack of self asset tion and self reliance . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Eras are to be measured by their positive powers : the period of the Renaissance accordingly , so profuse and fateful , presents itself as the last great period and we modern men , with our anxious self nursing and brotherly love , with our virtues of labour , pretentiousness , fair play , and scientific spirit accumulating , economic , mechanical , we re present a weak period . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Our virtues are determined , are peremptorily called forth by our weakness . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Equality , as an actual approximation to similarity , of which the theory of equal rights is but the ex expression , belongs essentially to decadence : the gap between man and man , between class and class , the multiplicity of types , the will to assert itself , to stand out in contrast , that which I call pathos of distance belongs to every vigorous period . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The power of stretch , the width of stretch between the extremes , becomes always smaller at present , the extremes themselves finally merge into similarity . <end>
<unchecked> <start> All our political theories and state constitutions , the German Empire by no means excepted , are consequences , resulting necessities , of decadence the unconscious operation of decadence has gained the ascendency so far as to affect the ideals of some of the sciences . <end>
<unchecked> <start> My objection against the whole of the sociology of England and France is that it only knows decaying types of society by ex experience , and quite innocently takes its own instincts of decay as the standard for sociological valuations . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Deteriorating life , the decline of all organising power i . <end>
<unchecked> <start> e . <end>
<unchecked> <start> separating , gap making , subordinating and power is formulated as the ideal , in the socio log of the present day . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Our socialists are decadent Mr . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Herbert Spencer , ho never , is also a decadent , he sees something desirable in the triumph of altruism . <end>
<unchecked> <start> My concept of freedom . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The worth of a thing lies sometimes not in what one attains with it , but in what one pays for it , what it costs us . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I give an ex ample . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Liberal institutions immediately cease to be liberal , so soon as they are attained afterwards , there are no more mischievous or more radical enemies of freedom than liberal institutions . <end>
<unchecked> <start> One knows well enough what they accomplish : they undermine the will to power , they are the levelling of mountain and valley exalted into morality , they make people small , cowardly , and voluptuous , with them the herding animal always triumphs . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Liberalism : that is in creased herding animality . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The same institutions produce quite other results so long as they are fought for they then , in fact , further freedom in a powerful manner . <end>
<unchecked> <start> On looking more accurately , we see that it is warfare which produces these results , warfare for liberal institutions , which , as war , allows illiberal in stints to continue . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And warfare educates for freedom . <end>
<unchecked> <start> For what is freedom ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> To have the will to be respond bible for one s self . <end>
<unchecked> <start> To keep the distance which separates us . <end>
<unchecked> <start> To become more indifferent to hardship , severity , privation , and even to life . <end>
<unchecked> <start> To be ready to sacrifice men for one s cause , one s self not excepted . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Freedom implies that manly instincts , instincts which delight in war and triumph , dominate over other instincts for example over the instincts of happiness . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The man who has become free , how much more the spirit which has become free , treads under foot the con species of well being dreamt of by shop keepers , Christians , cows , women , Englishmen , and other democrats . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The free man is a warrior . <end>
<unchecked> <start> How is freedom measured , in individuals , as well as in nations ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> By the resistance which has to be overcome , by the effort which it costs to retain superiority . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We should have to seek the highest type of free men where the highest resistance is constantly overcome : five paces from tyranny , close on the threshold of the danger of . <end>
<unchecked> <start> This is psychologically true , when we mean by tyrants pitiless and frightful instincts , which peremptorily call forth the maximum of authority and discipline the finest type is furnished by Julius Caesar it is also politically true let us but traverse the course of history . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The people who were worth something , who became worth something , never acquired their greatness under liberal institutions : great danger made something out of them which de serves reverence , danger which first teaches us to know our resources , our virtues , our shield and sword , our genius , which compels us to be strong . <end>
<unchecked> <start> First principle : men must require strength otherwise , they never attain it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Those great forcing houses for the strong , the strongest species of man that has hitherto existed , the aristocratic commonwealth of the pattern of Rome and Venice , understood freedom precisely in the sense in which I understand the word : as something which one has and has not , as something which one desires , which one wins by conquest . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Criticism of modernism . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Our institutions are no longer worth anything : that is a matter on which we are unanimous . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But the fault is not in the institutions , but in us . <end>
<unchecked> <start> After we have lost all instincts out of which institutions grow , the institutions themselves are being lost , because we are no longer suitable for them . <end>
<unchecked> <start> democratise has always been the decadence type of organising power : I have already Human , All nonhuman , Vol . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Aphorism characterised modern de democracy together with its incomplete forms , such as the German Empire as a declining type of the state . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In order that there may be institutions , there must be a species of will , instinct , or imperative , even to salinity : a will for tradition , for au authority , for responsibility throughout centuries , a will for the solidarity of chains of generations forward and backward in infinite . <end>
<unchecked> <start> When this will exists , some thing establishes itself like the Imperium Romanum or like Russia , the only power at present which has durability in its constitution , which can wait , and can yet promise something , Russia , the antithetical con caption to the pitiable European petty state misery and nervousness , which has got into a critical condition with the establishment of the German Empire . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The entire western world no longer possesses those in stints out of which institutions grow , out of which futurity grows perhaps nothing is so much against the grain of its modern spirit . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We live for the present , we live very fast , we live very irresponsibly : this is precisely what we call freedom . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That which makes institutions in reality is despised , hated , and repudiated : wherever the word authority even be comes audible , people believe themselves in danger of a new slavery . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Decadence goes so far in the apple active instinct of our politicians and political parties , that they prefer instinctively what disintegrates , what hastens the end . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Witness modern marriage . <end>
<unchecked> <start> All rationality has evidently been lost in modern marriage that does not however furnish an objection against marriage , but against modernism . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Rationality of mar rage it lay in the sole legal responsibility of the husband : marriage thus possessed gravity , while at present it halts on both legs . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Rationality of mar rage it lay in its on principle : it thus acquired an emphasis which , opposed to the accident of sentiment , passion , and momentary impulse , knew how to make itself heard . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Rationality of mar rage it lay likewise in the responsibility of families for the selection of the spouses . <end>
<unchecked> <start> By the increasing indulgence in favour of marriages for love , the basis of marriage , that which first of all makes it an instil tuition , has been almost eliminated . <end>
<unchecked> <start> An institution is never , and never will be founded on an idiocy crash : marriage , as we have said , cannon be founded on love , it is founded on sexual impulse , on the impulse to possess property woman and child as property , on the impulse to rule , which constantly organises for itself the smallest type of sovereignty family , which needs children and heirs to maintain physiologically an acquired measure of power , influence and riches , to prepare for long tasks , and for from one century to another . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Marriage , as an institution , already involves the affirmation of the greatest and most permanent form of organisation : if society cannon as a whole pledge itself to the re modest generations , marriage has no meaning at all . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Modern marriage has lost its meaning , consequently , it is being done away with . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The labour question . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The fact that there is a labour question is owing to stupidity , or , at bottom , instinct degeneration , which is the cause of all existing stupidity . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Regarding certain things one does not question : the first imperative of instinct . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I do not at all understand what people want to do with the Euro mean working man , now that they have made a question of him . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He finds himself far too advantageously sitka ted not to go on questioning further , ever less mo deftly . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He has at last the majority on his side . <end>
<unchecked> <start> There is no hope now that a modest and self contented species of human being , a type like the Chinese , will here constitute itself into a class : this would have been the rational course , this would have been almost a necessity . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But what have people done ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Everything possible to annihilate even the germ of the pre requisite for such a course through the most unjustifiable thoughtlessness people have fundamentally destroyed the instincts in virtue of which the working man becomes possible as a class , possible for himself . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The working man has been made capable of military ser vice , he has been given the right of combination and the right of the franchise : no wonder he already feels his existence as a state of exigency morally expressed , as injustice . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But what do people want ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> let it be asked once more . <end>
<unchecked> <start> If they want to realise an end , they must also be willing to use the means : if they want to have slaves , it is foolish to educate them to be masters . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Freedom w r which I do not mean . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In such times as the present , it is an additional peril to be left to one s instincts . <end>
<unchecked> <start> These instincts mutually contra diet , disturb , and destroy themselves I have already defined modernism as physiological self contradiction . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A rational education would claim that one , at least , of those instinct systems should be paralysed under an iron pressure , to enable another system to attain power , to become strong and predominant . <end>
<unchecked> <start> At pre sent one would have to make the individual possible in the first place , by pruning him . <end>
<unchecked> <start> To make him possible , that is to say , to make him an entirety . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The very reverse happens : independence , free dave moment , and aller are claimed the most vere gently precisely by those for whom no restraint would be too severe this is true in politics , it is true in art . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But that is a symptom of decadence : our modern notion of freedom is an additional proof of edge negation of instinct . <end>
<unchecked> <start> An allusion to Max von Schenkendorf s poem : freshest , die ich mine . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Where belief is necessary . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Nothing is rarer among moralists and saints than rectitude perhaps they say the contrary , perhaps they even believe it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> For when a belief is more useful , more efficacious , and more convincing than conscious hypocrisy , owing to instinct , hypocrisy forthwith becomes innocence : first prop position for understanding great saints . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Among philo hers also , another species of saints , the whole busi ness involves the necessity of only admitting certain truths , namely those on the basis of which their busi ness has public sanction , in Kantian language , the truths of practical reason . <end>
<unchecked> <start> They know what they must prove , they are practical therein , they recognise one another by being in mutual agreement with regard to truths . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Thou shalt not lie i . <end>
<unchecked> <start> e . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Mr . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Philosopher , be on your guard , lest you speak the truth . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Whispered into the ear of the conservatives . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What people did not know before , what they now know , or might know , a retrogression , a return in any sense , or to any extent , is quite impossible . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We physiologists , at least , know that . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But all priests and moralists have believed it possible , they wanted to bring mankind back , to screw mankind down to an of virtue . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Morality has always been a procrustean bed . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Politicians even have imitated the preachers of virtue in this respect at present also , there are parties who dream of the crabs march of everything , as the final goal . <end>
<unchecked> <start> No one , however , is at liberty to be a crab . <end>
<unchecked> <start> There is no help for it : we are obliged to go forward , that is to say , step by step onwards in decadence this is my definition of modern progress . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We can check this development , and by checking it , we can dam up and collect edge negation itself , making it more vehement and sudden we cannon do more . <end>
<unchecked> <start> My notion of genius . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Great men , like great pe riots , are explosive materials in which an immense force is accumulated it is always pre requisite for such men , historically and physiologically , that for a long period there has been a collecting , a heaping up , an economising , and a hoarding , with respect to them , that for a long time no explosion has taken place . <end>
<unchecked> <start> When the tension in the substance has become too great , the most accidental stimulus suffices to call into the world the genius , the deed , and grand destiny . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Of what consequence then is the environs ment , the epoch , the spirit of the age , or public opinion ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let us take the case of Napoleon . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The France of the Revolution and still more pre rev cautionary France would have produced a type anti chemical to Napoleon : it did produce it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And because Napoleon was of a different type , the heir of a stronger , more enduring and older civilisation than that which vanished into vapour and fragments in France , he became master , he alone was the master here . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The great men are necessary , the time when they appear is contingent that they almost always become masters of their age , just depends on the fact that they are stronger , older , and possess longer acc mutated forces . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Between a genius and his age there exists a relation like that between the strong and the weak , between the old and the young : the age is , relatively , always much younger , more slender , more immature , more assured , and more childish . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That people at present think very differently concerning this matter in France and in Germany also , but that is of no consequence , that the theory of the milieu , a true neuropathic theory , has there become sacrosanct and almost scientific , finding belief even among why biologists that has a bad odour , it gives one mean holy thoughts . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In England also , the thing is under stood in the very same manner but nobody will fret about that . <end>
<unchecked> <start> There are only two ways in which an Englishman can account for a genius or great man : either democratically in the manner of Buckle , or re viciously in the manner of Carlyle . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The peril involved in great men and great ages is excessive exhaustion every kind and sterility follow in their footsteps . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The great man is a close the great period , the Re renaissance , for example , is a close . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The genius in work , in deed is necessarily a squandered his great ness is that lie expends himself . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The instinct of self preservation is , as it were , out of gear in the ge pius the over powerful pressure of the outflow of his energies forbids all such care and foresight . <end>
<unchecked> <start> People call this sacrifice , they praise the heroism of genius , his indifference to his own welfare , his devotion to an idea , to a great cause , or to his country : it is all misunderstanding however . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He outflows , he overflows , he uses himself up , he does not spare him self hatefully , portentously , involuntarily , as a river involuntarily overflows its banks . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But because people owe much to such explosives they have , on the other hand , bestowed much upon them for example , a sort of hillier morality . <end>
<unchecked> <start> For that is the mode of human gratitude : it misunderstands its benefactors . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The criminal and those related to him . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The cri final type that is the type of the strong man under unfavourable conditions , a strong man who has been made sick . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He lacks the wilderness , a certain freer and more dangerous environment , and mode of being , in which all that is offensive and defensive in his in stints exists by right . <end>
<unchecked> <start> His virtues are put in ban by society the most lively impulses instinctive to him become forthwith interwoven with depressing emotions , with suspicion , fear , and disgrace . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But this is almost the recipe for producing physiological de generation . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He who , with prolonged suspense , fore sight , and cunning , has to do secretly what he can best do , what he would most readily do , becomes anaemic and because he gains nothing but danger , persecution , and calamity through his instincts , his sentiment towards them quite alters : he regards them as fatalistic . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is society , our domesticated , mediocre , emasculated society , in which a man with his natural forces unimpaired , coming from the mountains or from sea faring adventures , necessarily degenerates into a criminal . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Or almost necessarily for there are cases in which such a man proves himself stronger than society : the Corsican Napoleon is the most cele rated case . <end>
<unchecked> <start> For the problem before us , the testimony of dostoievsky is of importance dostoievsky , the only psychologist , let it be said , from whom I had anything to learn he belongs to the happiest chance incidents of my life , still more even than the discover ing of Stendhal . <end>
<unchecked> <start> This profound man , who was ten times right to depreciate the superficial Germans , has perceived that the Siberian convicts , in whose midst he lived for a long time capital criminals for whom there was no return to society , were quite other than he himself expected , persons carved almost out of the best , the hardest and the most valuable material to be found in the Russian dominions . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let us generalise the case of the criminal : let us realise the disposition of persons , who , from any cause whatsoever , lack public approbation , who know that they are not regarded as salutary and serviceable to society , that chantal feeling of being counted inferior , outcast , unworthy , and defiling . <end>
<unchecked> <start> All such natures have the colour of the subterranean , in their thoughts and actions everything in them becomes paler than in those on whose existence daylight rests . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But almost all modes of existence which we at present signals , have formerly lived in this semi sepulchral atom sphere , the scientific man of character , the artist , the genius , the free spirit , the actor , the merchant , the great discoverer . <end>
<unchecked> <start> As long as the priest passed for the highest type , every meritorious variety of human being was depreciated . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The time is coming I promise it when the priest will be regarded as the lowest type , as our chantal , as the most mendacious , the most disreputable variety of human being . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I direct attention to the fact that even at present under the mildest sway of custom that has ever existed on earth , at least in Europe , every mode of separateness , every protracted , all too protracted condition of subtler position , every unusual , non transparent mode of existence , ap proximate men to the type of which the criminal is the climax . <end>
<unchecked> <start> All intellectual innovators have , for a time , the pale and portentous sign of the chantal on their foreheads not because they should be felt as such , but because they themselves are sensible of the fright ful gulf which separates them from everything tra national and honourable . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Almost every genius knows the Catilinarian existence as one of his developments , a hateful , vengeful , insurrectionary feeling against everything which already is , which does not any longer become . <end>
<unchecked> <start> caroline the pre existent form of every Caesar . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Here the prospect is open . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It may be loftiness of soul when a philosopher is silent it may be love when he contradicts himself in a knowing one a court easy which speaks falsely is possible . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It has been said not without acuteness : il est indian des grands c us de le trouble qu ils resentment only , one has to add that it may likewise be greatness of soul to have no fear of the meanest things . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A woman who loves sacrifices her honour a knowing one who loves perhaps sacrifices his humanity a God who loved became a Jew . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Beauty no accident . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Even the beauty of a race or family , the pleasantness and kindness of their whole demeanour , is acquired by effort like genius , it is the final result of the accumulated labour of generations . <end>
<unchecked> <start> There must have been great sacrifices made to good taste for the sake of it , much must have been done , and much refrained from the seven teeth century in France is worthy of admiration in both ways good taste must then have been a principle of selection , for society , place , dress , and sexual grate fiction : beauty must have been preferred to advani take , habit , opinion , indolence . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Supreme rule : we must not let ourselves go , even when only in our own presence . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Good things are costly beyond measure , and the rule always holds , that he who possesses them is other than he who acquires them . <end>
<unchecked> <start> All excellence is inheritance what has not been in merited is imperfect , it is a beginning . <end>
<unchecked> <start> At Athens in the time of Cicero , who expresses his surprise with regard to it , men and youths were far superior to women in beauty : but what labour and effort in the service of beauty had the Athenian males required of themselves for centuries ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> We must not make a mistake here with regard to method : the mere rearing of feelings and thoughts is almost valueless it is here that German culture , which is entirely illusory , makes its great mistake we have first to persuade the body . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The strict maintenance of significant and select de manor , an obligation to live only with those who do not let themselves go , suffices perfectly for become ing significant and select in two or three generations everything has become . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is decisive for the fortune of a people and of humanity , that civil station begin at the right place not at soul as was the baneful superstition of priests and the right place is body , demeanour , regimen , physiology the rest follows therefrom . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is on that account that the Greeks are the leading event in the history of civilisation : they knew , they did what was necessary Christianity , which despised the body , has hitherto been the greatest misfortune for the human race . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Progress as I understand it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I also speak of a re turn to nature , although it is not properly a going back , but a going up up into high , free , and even frightful nature and naturalness , such as plays , or may play , with great tasks . <end>
<unchecked> <start> To express it in a simile , Napoleon was an instance of a return to nature , as I understand it for example , in rebus tactics , and still more in strategy , as military men are aware . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But Rousseau where did he really want to return to ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Rousseau , that first modern man , idealist and camille in one person needing moral dignity to endure his own aspect sick with wanton conceit and wanton self contempt ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> And even this abortion , which de posited itself on the threshold of the modern age , wanted return to nature where , let us ask again , did Rousseau want to return to ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> hate Rousseau , hate him in the Revolution itself : it is the grand historical expression of this dualism of idealist and camille . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The bloody farce with which that revolution played itself out , its immorality , is of little account to me what I hate is its Rousseau w ra z y the so called truths of the revolution with which it operates to the present day , and wins over to itself all the shallow and mediocre . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The doctrine of equality ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> But there exists no deadlier poison for it seems to be preached by justice itself , while it does away with justice . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Equality to the equal , inequality to the unequal that would be the true teaching of justice and the corollary likewise , Never make the unequal equal . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That such dreadful and bloody events happened around the doctrine of equality , has given a sort of glory and to this modern idea par excellence : so that the revolution as a spectacle has seduced even the noblest minds . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That is , after all , no reason for steering it any higher . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I see only one who regarded it as it must be regarded , with disgust Gee the . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Gee the . <end>
<unchecked> <start> No mere German event , but a European event a grand attempt to surmount the eighteenth century , by a return to nature , by an ascension to the naturalness of the Renaissance , a kind of self sur mounting on the part of that century . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He possessed its strongest instincts : its sentimentality , its nature worship , its tendencies anti historic , idealistic , unreal , and revolutionary the last is only a form of the unreal . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He called to his aid history , science , antiquity , and like wise Spinoza , but above all practical activity he en circled himself with nothing but denied horizons he did not sever himself from life , but placed himself in it he was not responding , and took as much as possible on himself , over himself , and into himself . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What he aspired to was totality he struggled against the severance of reason , sensuousness , emotion and vill preached in the most forbidding scholasticism by Kant , the antipodes of Goethe , he disciplined him self to entirety , he created himself . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Goethe was a convinced realist in the midst of an age disposed to the unreal he was affirmative of everything analogous to himself in this respect , he had no more important experience than that ens named Napoleon . <end>
<unchecked> <start> goethe conceived of a personality robust and , skilful in all physical accomplishments , keeping himself in check , and maintaining his self reverence , who dares to allow himself the whole realm and riches of naturalness , and is strong enough for that freedom the man of toleration , not out of weakness , but out of strength , because he knows how to use advent what would cause the ruin of average con institutions the man to whom there is nothing pro limited unless it be weakness , whether it is designated vice or virtue . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A mind thus emancipated , stands with a cheerful and confident fatalism in the midst of the universe , in the belief that only the single thing is resectable , that , on the whole , everything is saved and maintained : he no longer denies . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But such a be life is the highest of all possible beliefs : I have christened it with the name of Dionysos We might say that , in a certain sense , the nine teeth century has likewise aspired after all that goethe himself aspired after : universality in under standing and approving , a quiet reserve towards every thing , an audacious realism , and reverence for all matters of fact . <end>
<unchecked> <start> How is it that the sum total is no goethe , but a chaos , a nihilistic groaning , a grievous uncertainty as to whence and whither , an instinctive weariness which in praxis impels men continually to hark back to the eighteenth century ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> For example , as emotional Romanticism , as altruism , as hyper sentiment laity , as feminism in taste , and as socialism in politics . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Is not the nineteenth century , especially at its close , merely a strengthened and brutalised eighteenth century , i . <end>
<unchecked> <start> e . <end>
<unchecked> <start> a decadence century ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> So that goethe would have been merely an episode , a splendid , vain effort , not only for Germany , but for Europe as a whole ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> But we misunderstand great men when we look at them from the narrow perspective of public utility . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That we do not know how to derive ad vantage from them that itself perhaps belongs to greatness . <end>
<unchecked> <start> goethe is the last German for whom I have re terence he would have felt three things which I feel , we also understand one another with regard to the cross . <end>
<unchecked> <start> People often ask me why in the world I write in German : I have been nowhere less read than in my own country . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But who knows , after all , if I even want to be read at present ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> To create things on which time vainly tries its teeth as regards form , as regards substance , to make an effort after a little immortality . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I was never yet modest enough to require less of myself . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Aphorism and the sentence , in which I , as the foremost among the Germans , am master , are the forms of eternity my ambition is to say in ten sentences what every one else says in a book , what every one else does not say in a book . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I have given to mankind the profoundest book it possesses , my zarathustra : I shall shortly give it the most independent one . <end>
<unchecked> <start> MY INDEBTEDNESS TO THE ancients word in conclusion with regard to that world to which I have sought access , to which I have per has found a new entrance , the ancient w r world . <end>
<unchecked> <start> My taste , which may be the contrary of a tolerant taste , is here , as in other cases , far from making an union national affirmation : on the whole , it does not readily say yea it rather prefers nay it likes best of all to say nothing whatever . <end>
<unchecked> <start> This applies to entire civil nations , it applies to books , it applies also to places and landscapes . <end>
<unchecked> <start> After all it is only a very small number of ancient books that count in my life the most celebrated ones are not among them . <end>
<unchecked> <start> My sense for style , for the epigram as style , awakened almost instantaneously on coming in contact with smallest I have not forgotten the astonishment of my venerated teacher crossed , when he had to give the highest number of marks to his worst Latin scholar , I had done all at once . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Compressed , rigid , with as much substance as possible in the back ground , a cool malice against fine words and fine sentiment also , I therewith found my vein . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In my writings , up to my Zarathustra , a very strenuous ambition to attain the Roman style , the Ere perennis in style will be recognised . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It was the same with me on my first contact with Horace . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Up to the present , I have not received from any poet the same artistic rapture as was given to me from the first by an Horatian ode . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In certain languages that which is attained there cannon even be willed . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That lingual mosaic where every word , as sound , as position , and as notion , diffuses its force right , left , and over the whole , that minimum in the compass and number of signs , that maximum thus realised in their energy , all that is Roman , and , if you will believe me , it is noble par excellence . <end>
<unchecked> <start> All other poetry becomes somewhat too popular in com prison with it , mere sentimental loquacity . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I am not at all under obligation to the Greeks for any similarly strong impressions , and , to speak out candidly , they cannon be to us what the Romans are . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We do not learn from the Greeks : their mode is too foreign , it is also too unstable to operate imperatively or classically . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Who would ever have learned to write from a Greek ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Who would ever have learned it without the Romans ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Plato need not be brought forward as an objection to me . <end>
<unchecked> <start> With respect to Plato , I am a thorough sceptic , and I have always been unable to assent to the admiration of Plato the artist , which is traditional among scholars . <end>
<unchecked> <start> After all , I have here the most refined judges of taste among the ancients them selves on my side . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Plato , as it seems to me , jumbles together all the forms of style he is thus a first decadent in style : he has something on his con science like what the Cynics have who discovered the saturn Menippea . <end>
<unchecked> <start> To be operated upon by the Platonic dialogue that shockingly self complacent and childish kind of dialectics , a person must never have read good French literature , Fontenelle , for example . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Plato is tiresome . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In the end my distrust of Plato goes deeper than the surface : I find him strayed so far from all fundamental instincts of the Hellenes , so , so pre existent Christian he has already the concept good as the highest concept , that I should prefer to employ the hard expression , superior cheaters , with reference to the whole phenomenon of Plato or , if people like it better , idealism , rather than any other term . <end>
<unchecked> <start> People have paid dearly for this Athenian s going to school with the Egyptians or with the Jews in Egypt ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> In the great fatality of Christianity , Plato is the ambiguity and fascination called the ideal , which made it possible for the nobler minds of antiquity to misunderstand themselves , and enter on the bridge which led to the cross . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And how much of Plato is still in the concept of Church , in the organisation , system , and practice of the Church ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> My recreation , my predilection , my cure from all platonist , has always been Thucydides . <end>
<unchecked> <start> thuc. <end>
<unchecked> <start> sides and perhaps machiavelli s Principe are nearest akin to me in the unconditioned will to impose nothing on themselves , and in their determination to see the rational in reality , not in reason , and still less in morality . <end>
<unchecked> <start> There is no better corrective than Thucydides of the pitiable tendency to beautify the Greeks in the direction of the ideal , a tendency which the youth trained in humanities carries away with him into life as the reward of his public school drilling . <end>
<unchecked> <start> One has to turn his writings over line by line , and read his mental reserve as distinctly as his words : there are few thinkers so rich in mental reserve . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Sophist civilisation , I mean to say realist civilisation , attains its most perfect expression in Thucydides : that inestimable movement in the midst of the moral and ideal cheaters of the Socratic Schools , which , just then , was breaking out everywhere . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Greek philo sophy as the decadence of Greek instinct Thucydides as the great sum , the last revelation of that strong , stern , hard matter of fastness , which was instinctive in the older Hellenes . <end>

<unchecked> <start> To scent out beautiful souls , golden medio cities , and other perfections in the Greeks , perhaps to admire in them the repose in grandeur , the ideal disposition , lofty simplicity from this lofty sim publicity a allemandi in the end , I was preserved by the psychologist implanted in my nature . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I saw their strongest instinct , the will to power , I saw them quake in presence of the intractable force of this impulse , I saw all their institutions evolve out of pro receive measures to secure themselves mutually from their innate explosive material . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The enormous internal tension then discharged itself externally , in dreadful and reckless hostility : the city communities lacerated themselves in conflict with one another , in order that the citizens of each might find peace within themselves . <end>
<unchecked> <start> People required to be strong danger was close at hand , it lurked everywhere . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The magnificently supple physique , the daring realism and immorality which belonged to the helene , were an exigency , not a temperament . <end>
<unchecked> <start> These qualities only came in course of time , they were not there from the beginning . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And the Greeks desired naught else but to feel them selves dominant , to show themselves dominant with their festivals and arts : these things were expedients for self glorification , under certain circumstances for inspiring terror . <end>
<unchecked> <start> To judge the Greeks by their philo gophers in the German manner , to avail one s self per chance of the affected of the Socratic Schools for disclosures as to what is fundamentally Hellenic ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> For the philosophers are the decadent of Grecianism , the counter movement against ancient , noble taste against the atonal instinct , against the polis , against the worth of the race , against the authority of tradition . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Socratic virtues were preached because they had been lost by the Greeks : excitable , timid , fickle , all of them comedians , they had a few reasons too many for allowing morality to be preached to them . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Not that it helped , but great words and attitudes suit decadent so well . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I was the first for the purpose of understanding the older , still copious , and even overflowing Hellenic instinct , to take seriously that wonderful phenomenon which bears the name of Dionysos : it is only ex playable by a surplus of energy . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Whoever had devoted his attention to the Greeks , like that profoundest student of their civilisation at present living , Jacob Burckhardt of Bale , was at once aware has been achieved thereby : Burckhardt inserted a special chapter into his culture der G rice i en on the phenomenon referred to . <end>
<unchecked> <start> If one wants the contrast one may look at the almost ex exhilarating poverty of instinct in German philologists , when they come into proximity with the Dionysian . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The celebrated lubeck especially , who , with the veneer able assurance of a worm dried up between books , crept into this world of mysterious conditions , and , by being frivolous and childish ad nausea , persuaded himself that he was scientific , lubeck , with great display of learning , has given to understand that it is really no matter about all these curiosities . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In fact , the priests might have communicated some not unit portent information to those who took part in such orgies for example , that wine excites lust , that under certain circumstances man lives on fruit , that plants blossom in spring and wither in autumn . <end>
<unchecked> <start> As regards that strange wealth of rites , symbols , and myths of orgiastic origin with which the ancient world is literally overgrown , lubeck finds in it an occasion to become a trifle more ingenious . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The Greeks , he says Aglaophamns I . <end>
<unchecked> <start> when they had nothing else to do , laughed , jumped , and raged about , or , because people have also sometimes a desire for that , they sat down , wept , and lamented . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Others came there later on , and sought , sure enough , some reason for the strange behaviour and thus the numberless festival legends and myths arose for the explanation of those practices . <end>
<unchecked> <start> On the other hand , people believed that that ludicrous performance which took place by custom on the festive days , belonged necessarily to festal celebration , and they retained it as an indispensable part of Divine worship . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That is contemptible gossip , one will not for a moment take lubeck seriously . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We are affected quite otherwise when we examine the concept of Grecian which Winckelmann and Goethe had formed for themselves , and when we find it incompatible with that element orgasm out of which Dionysian art evolves . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In fact , I do not doubt that Goethe would have thoroughly excluded anything of that kind from the potentialities of the Greek soul . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Consequently , Goethe did not understand the Greeks . <end>
<unchecked> <start> For only in Dionysian mysteries , in the psychology of the Dionysian condition , does the fundamental fact of Hellenic instinct its will to life express itself . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What did the helene pledge himself for with these mysteries ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Eternal life , eternal recurrence of life the future promised and consecrated in the past the triumphing affirmation of life beyond death and change true life , as the universal continuation of life by generation , by the mysteries of sexuality . <end>
<unchecked> <start> On that account , the sexual symbol was to the Greeks the symbol venerable in itself , the intrinsic profundity within all ancient piety . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Every detail in the act of generation , in pregnancy , and in birth , awakened the most exalted and solemn sentiments . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In the doctrine of mysteries pain is pronounced holy : the pains of travail sanctify pain in general , all becoming and growing , all pledging for the future , involves suffering . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In order that the eternal delight of creating may exist , that the will to life may assert itself eternally , there must also exist eternally the pains of travail . <end>
<unchecked> <start> All this is implied by the word Dionysos : I know of no higher symbolism than this Greek symbolism of dionysiac . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In them the deepest instinct of life , the instinct for the future of life , for the eternity of life , is felt religiously the way itself to life , procreation , is recognised as the sacred way . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is only Christianity , with its resentment against life at the bottom , which has caused sexuality to be regarded as something impure : it cast dirt on the commencement , on the pre requisite of our life . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The psychology of orgasm , as an exuberant feeling of life and energy , in which pain even operates as a stimulus , gave me the key to the concept of tragic feeling which has been misunderstood , as well by Aristotle , as especially by our pessimists . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Tragedy is so far from proving anything with regard to a pepsi miss of the Hellenes , in the sense of Schopenhauer , that it is rather to be looked upon as the decisive repudiation of pessimism , and as a verdict against it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The affirmation of life , even in its most unfamiliar and most severe problems , the will to live , enjoying its own in the sacrifice of its highest types , that is what I called Dionysian , that is what I divined as the bridge to a psychology of the tragic poet . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Not in order to get rid of terror and pity , not to purify from a dangerous passion by its vehement discharge it was thus that Aristotle understood it but , beyond terror and pity , to realise in fact the eternal delight of becoming , that delight which even involves in itself the joy of annihilating . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And hereby I again touch at the place from which I once set out , the Birth of Tragedy was my first Transvaluation of all Values : hereby I place myself again on the soil out of which my willing , my ability has evolved I , the last disciple of Dionysos the philo soper , I , the teacher of eternal recurrence . <end>

<unchecked> <start> Modern man per has ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> I do not know out or in I am whatever does not know out or in sighs modern man . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We were ill from that modernism , from lazy peace , from cowardly compromise , from the whole virtuous uncleanness of modern yea and nay . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That tolerance and larger of heart which forgives all because it understands all , is morocco to us . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Better to live in the ice than among modern virtues and other south winds ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> We were brave enough , we spared neither ourselves nor others but we did not knowhow a long time where to direct our bravery . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We became gloomy , were called fatalist . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Our fate that was the fullness , the tension , the damming up of our forces . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We twisted for lightning and for achievement , we were furthest removed from the happiness of weaklings , from resignation . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A tempest was in our atmosphere nature which we embody was darkened , r we had no path . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The formula of our happiness : a yea , a nay , a straight line , a goal . <end>

<unchecked> <start> Not connectedness , but more power not peace at any price , but warfare not virtue but capacity virtue in the Renaissance style , virtue , virtue free from any moral acid . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The weak and ill constituted shall perish : first principle of our charity . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And people shall help them to do so . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What is more injurious than any crime ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Practical sympathy for all the ill constituted and weak : Christianity . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The problem which I here put is not what is to replace mankind in the chain of beings man is an end , but what type of man we are to cultivate , we are to will , as the more valuable , the more worthy of life , the more certain of the future . <end>
<unchecked> <start> This more valuable type has often enough existed already : but as a happy accident , as an exception , never as willed . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It has rather just been the most feared it has hitherto been almost the terror and out of that terror , the reverse type has been willed , cultivated , attained the domestic animal , the herding animal , the sickly animal man , the Christian . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Mankind does not manifest a development to the better , the stronger , or the higher , in the manner in which it is at present believed . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Progress is merely a modern idea , i . <end>
<unchecked> <start> e . <end>
<unchecked> <start> a false idea . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The European of the present is , in worth , far below the European of the Renaissance onward development is by no means , by any necessity , elevating , enhancing , strengthening . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In another sense , there is a continuous success of single cases in the most different parts of earth , and from the most different civilisations , in which , in fact , a higher type manifests itself : something which , inflation to collective mankind , is a sort of . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Such happy accidents of grand success have always been possible , and will , perhaps , always be possible . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And even entire races , tribes , and nations can , under certain circumstances , represent such a good Inf . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We must not embellish or deck out Christianity : it has waged a deadly war against this higher type of man , it has put in ban all fundamental instincts of this type , it has distilled evil , the evil one , out of these instincts : strong man as the typical reprobate , as out cast man . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Christianity has taken the part of all the weak , the low , the ill constituted , it has made an ideal out of the antagonism to the preservative in stints of strong life it has ruined the reason even of the intellectually strongest natures , in that it taught men to regard the highest values of intellectuality as sinful , as misleading , as temptations . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The most lament able example : the ruin of Pascal , who believed in the ruin of his intellect by original sin , while it had only been ruined by his Christianity ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is a painful and thrilling spectacle that has pre seated itself to me : I have drawn back the curtain from the depravity of man . <end>
<unchecked> <start> This word in my mouth is , at all events , guarded against one suspicion : that it involves a moral accusation of man . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is I should like to underline it once more meant in the sense of freedom from any moral acid , and this to the extent that that depravity is felt by me most strongly just there , where one hitherto most consciously aspired to virtue and Divinity . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I understand depravity , one makes it out already , in the sense of decadence : my assertion is that all values in which mankind now comprise their highest desirability are decadence values . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I call an animal , a species , an individual , depraved , when it loses its instincts , when it selects , when it prefers what is injurious to it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A history of higher sentiments , of ideals of mankind and it is possible that I shall have to tell it again , would be almost the explanation also why man is so depraved . <end>
<unchecked> <start> L itself I regard as instinct for growth , for contain an d for accumulation of forces , for power : where the f n to power is wanting there is decline . <end>
<unchecked> <start> My assertion is that this will is lacking in all the highest values of mankind , that values of decline , nihilistic values , bear rule under the holiest names . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Christianity is called the religion of sympathy . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Sympathy stands in antithesis to the tonic passions which elevate the energy of the feeling of life : it operates repressively . <end>
<unchecked> <start> One loses force by symap thing . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The loss of force which suffering has already brought upon life is still further increased and multi plied by sympathy . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Suffering itself becomes costa pious through sympathy under certain circumstances a total loss of life and vital energy may about J gt y . <end>
<unchecked> <start> sympathy , such as stands in an absurd pro portion to the extent of the cause the case of the death of the nazareth . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That is the first point of view there is , however , one still more important . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Sup posing one measures sympathy according to the value of the reaction which , as a rule , it brings about , its mortally dangerous character appears in a much clearer M L rx get st ill Sympathy thwarts , on the whole , in general , the law of development , which i s the law of selection . <end>
<unchecked> <start> stir press yes what is ripe for extinction , it resists in of ti r of life s disinherited and condemned ones , it moves to life itself a gloomy and questionable aspect by the abundance of the ill constituted of all kinds whom it maintains in life . <end>
<unchecked> <start> One has dared to call sympathy a virtue m every superior morality it is regarded as a weakness one has gone further , one has made it the virtue , the basis and source of all virtues , only , to be sure which one must always keep in sight from the point of view of a philosophy which was nihilistic , which inscribed the negation of life on its escutcheon ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Schopenhauer was right in maintaining that life was negatived by sympathy , was made worthier of negation , sympathy is the practice of nihilism . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Once more repeated : this depressive and contagious instinct thwarts those instincts which strive for the maintenance and elevation of the value of life : it is , both as the multiplier of misery and as the conservator of all misery , a principal tool for the advancement of decadence , sympathy persuades to nothingness . <end>
<unchecked> <start> One does not say nothingness : one says instead , the other world or God or true life or Nirvana , salvation , blessedness . <end>
<unchecked> <start> This innocent rhetoric , out of the domain of idiosyncrasy , appears forthwith much less into cent , when one understands what tendency here wraps around itself the mantle of sublime expressions the tendency hostile to life , Schopenhauer was hostile to life : therefore sympathy became to him a virtue . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Aristotle , as is known , saw in sympathy a sickly another to get at by a purgative : he understood tragedy as a purgative . <end>
<unchecked> <start> From the instinct of life , one should in fact seek an expedient to put a puncture in such a morbid and dangerous accumulation of sympathy as the case of Schopenhauer manifests and alas also , our entire literary and artistic decadence from St . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Peters burg to Paris , from tolstoy to Wagner , that that bubble might burst . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Nothing amidst our unsound modern ism is unfounded than Christian sympathy . <end>
<unchecked> <start> To be a physician here , to be pitiless here , to apply the knife here that belongs to us , that is our mode of charity thereby we are philosophers , we Hyper koreans ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is necessary to say whom we regard as our antithesis : theologians , and everything that has theo logical blood in its veins our entire philosophy . <end>
<unchecked> <start> One must have seen the fatality close at hand , or , better still , one must have experienced it in one s self , one must have been almost ruined by it , to regard it no longer as a jocular affair the free-thinking of Mes spurs our naturalists and physiologists is in my eyes a joke they lack in these matters , the suffering from them . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That poisoning extends far wider than one supposes I discovered the theological in stint of haughtiness everywhere where people at pre sent regard themselves as idealists , where , in vir tue of a higher origin , they assume the right to cast looks superior and strange at actuality . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The ideal ist , precisely like the priest , has all the great copy cents in his hand and not in his hand only , he plays them with a benevolent contempt against the understanding , the senses , honours , good living , and science he sees such under him , as injurious and seductive forces , over which spirit soars in pure being by itself ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> as if submissiveness , chastity , poverty , in a word holiness had not hitherto done unutterably more injury to life than any fright ful things or vices . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Pure spirit is pure lie . <end>
<unchecked> <start> As long as the priest still passes for a higher species human being , this denier , and poisoner of elf y J life by profession , there is no answer to the question . <end>
<unchecked> <start> rT PVVVpassesTfbr the representative of truth . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I make war against this theological instinct : I have found traces of it everywhere . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Whoever has theo logical blood in his veins is from the very beginning ambiguous and disloyal with respect to everything . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The pathos which develops therefrom calls itself belief : the closing of the eye once for all with respect to one s self , so as not to suffer from the sight of in curable falsity . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A person makes for himself a moral : y a virtue , a sanctity out of this erroneous perspective towards all things , he unites the good conscience the node of seeing , he demands that no other mode of perspective be any longer of value , after he has made his own sacrosanct with the names of God , salvation , and eternity . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I have dogged out the geologist instinct everywhere it is the most diffused , the most peculiarly subterranean form of falsity that exists on earth . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What a theo logan feels as true , must needs be false : one has therein almost a criterion of truth . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is his most fundamental self preservative instinct which forbids reality to be held in honour , or even to find ex expression on any point . <end>
<unchecked> <start> As far as geologist influence extends , the judgment of value is turned right about , the concepts of true and false are necessarily reversed : what is to lifes here called true , what raises , el yate a mas t justifies , and makes it triumph is called false . <end>
<unchecked> <start> If it happens that , through the conscience of princes or of the people , theologians stretch out their hand for power , let us not doubt what always takes place at bottom : the will to the end , nihilistic will seeks power . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Among Germans it is immediately understood when I say that philosophy is spoiled by theological blood . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The Protestant clergyman is the grandfather of German philosophy , Protestantism itself is its peat lm original . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Definition of Protestantism : the half sided paralysis of Christianity and reason . <end>
<unchecked> <start> One has only to utter the words College of tubing to comprehend what German philosophy is at bottom insidious divinity . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The fabians are the best liars in Germany , they lie innocently . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Whence the exaltation all over the German learned world three fourths of which is composed of the sons of clergymen and teachers on the appearance of Kant , whence the German conviction , which even still finds its echo , that with Kant a change for the better commenced ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> The geologist instinct in German scholars made out what was now once more possible . <end>
<unchecked> <start> a back door path to the old ideal now stood open , the concept of a true world , the concept of morality is essence of the world these two most virulent errors that exist ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> were again , thanks to a wily shrewd scepticism , if not demonstrable , at least no longer refutable . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Reason , the prerogative of reason , does not reach so far . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A had been made out of reality a world , completely fabricated by a lie , the world of what is , had been made reality . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The success of Kant is merely a geologist success : Kant , like Luther and like Leibniz , was an additional drag must be our contrivance , our most personal self . <end>
<unchecked> <start> r . <end>
<unchecked> <start> i defence and necessity : in every other sense it is merely a danger . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What does not condition our life injures it : a virtue merely out of a sentiment of respect for the concept of virtue , as Kant would have it , is injurious . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Virtue , duty , the good in itself , the good with the character of and universal validity chimeras , in which the decline , the final debilitating of life , Kcenigsbergian chinas , express themselves . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The very reverse is commanded by the most fundamental laws of maintenance and growth : that everyone devise his own virtue , his own categorical imperative for himself . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A it confounds its duty with the general . <end>
<unchecked> <start> concept of duty . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Nothing ruins more profoundly , or more in intrinsically than every impersonal duty , every sari five before the Moloch of abstraction . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I wonder that Kant s categorical imperative has not been felt as dangerous to life . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The geologist instinct alone took it under protection ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> An action to which the in stint of life impels has in its pleasure the proof that it is a right action : and that nihilist , with Christiandogmatic intestines , understood pleasure as an ob section . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What destroys faster than to work , think , or feel without internal necessity , without a pro fondly personal choice , without pleasure ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> as an automaton of duty ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is precisely the recipe for decadence , even for idiocy . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Kant became an idiot . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And that was the contemporary of Goethe ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> And this calamity of a cobweb spinner passed for the German philosopher , passes for it still ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> I take care not to say what I think of the Germans . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Has not Kant seen in the French Revolution the transition from the inorganic form of the state into the organic ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Did he not ask himself if there was an event which could not be explained otherwise than by a moral faculty in mankind , so that the tendency of mankind to goodness was proved by it once for all ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Kant s answer : That is revolution . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The erring instinct in each and everything , as instinct , German decadence as a philosophy that is Kant ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> I put a few sceptics apart , the decent type in the history of philosophy : the remainder are ignorant of the first requirements of intellectual uprightness . <end>
<unchecked> <start> All of them do just like little women , all those great enthusiasts and prodigies , they regard fine feelings as arguments , the expanded bosom as the bellows of Divinity , conviction as a criterion of truth . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In the end Kant attempted , with German innocence , to make scientific this form of corruption , this lack of intellectual conscience , under the concept of practice cal reason : he devised a reason expressly for the occasions in which one has not to trouble one s self about reason , namely , when morality , when the sublime requirement thou shalt becomes audible . <end>
<unchecked> <start> If one considers that , almost among all nations , the philo soper is only the further development of the priestly type , this inheritance of the priest , the spurious , self-imposed coinage , no longer surprises one . <end>
<unchecked> <start> When one has holy tasks , for example , to improve , to save , or to redeem men , when one carries Divinity in one s breast , when one is the mouthpiece of other world imperatives , with such a mission one is already out side of all merely reasonable valuations , one s self is already consecrated by such a task , it is already the type of a higher order ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> What does the priest care for science ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> He stands too high for it ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> And the priest has hitherto ruled ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> He has determined the concepts of true and untrue ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let us not underestimate this : we ourselves , we free spirits , are already a Transvaluation of all Values , an incarnate declaration of war against and triumph over all old concepts of true and untrue . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The most precious discernment into things are the latest discovered : the most precious discernment , however , are the methods . <end>
<unchecked> <start> All methods , all presuppositions of our present day science , have for millenniums been held in the most profound contempt : by reason of them a person was excluded from intercourse with honest men , he passed for an enemy of God , a despised of truth , a possessed person . <end>
<unchecked> <start> As a scientific man , a person was a chantal . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We have had the entire pathos of mankind against us , their concept of that which truth ought to be , which the service of truth ought te be : every thou shalt has been hitherto directed against us . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Our objects , our practices , our quiet , prudent , mistrustful mode all appeared to mankind as absolutely unworthy and con . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In the end one might with some reason idleness ask one s self if it was not really an aes thetis taste w r which kept mankind in such long blind ness : they wanted a picturesque effect from truth , they wanted in like manner the knowing ones to operate strongly on their senses . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Our modesty was longest against the taste of mankind . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Oh how they made that out , these turkey cocks of god have counter learned . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We have become more modest in everything . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We no longer derive man from spirit , from g godhead , we have put him back among the animals . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We regard him as the strongest animal because he is the most cunning : his intellectuality is a consequence thereof . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We guard ourselves , on the other hand , against a conceit which would fain be heard here once more : just as if man had been the great secret purpose of zoological evil tion . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He is by no means a crown of creation every being along with him is at an equal stage of per section . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And when we make that assertion , we still assert too much : man is , taken relatively , the worst constituted animal , the most sickly , the most danger ousley strayed from his instincts to be sure , with all that , also the most interesting ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> As regards animals Descartes was the first , who , with a boldness worthy of reverence , ventured the idea of conceiving of the animal as machine : our entire physiology interests itself about the proof of this proposition . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And , logic ally , we do not put man apart as Descartes did : whatever till now has been apprehended with regard to man reaches so far precisely as he has been apple ended mechanically . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Formerly one gave man free will as his dowry out of a higher order : at present we have taken even will from him , in the sense that no faculty can any longer be understood under the term . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The old w ord will serves only to designate a resultant , a kind of individual reaction which necks warily follows upon a number of partly antagonistic , partly incongruous stimuli : will no longer works , it no longer moves . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Formerly one saw in man s consciousness , in spirit , the proof of his higher origin , of his Divinity in order to perfect man , one advised him , after the manner of the tortoise , to withdraw the senses into himself , to cease having intercourse with the earthly , to shuffle off the mortal coil : then the main part of him remained behind , pure spirit . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We have also given better thought to this matter : the fact of becoming conscious , spirit , is regarded by us just as a symptom of the relative incompleteness of the organism , as an attempting , groping , mistaking , as a trouble by which unnecessarily much nerve force is used up , we deny that anything whatsoever can be made perfect as long as it is still made conscious . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Pure spirit is a pure stupidity when we deduct the nervous system and the senses , the mortal coil , our calculation is wrong that is all ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> In Christianity neither morality nor religion is in contact with any point of actuality . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Nothing but imaginary causes God , soul , ego , spirit , free will or even unfree will nothing but ma binary effects sin , salvation , grace , punish ment , forgiveness of sin . <end>
<unchecked> <start> An intercourse between imaginary beings God , spirits , souls an ma binary science of nature anthropocentric absolute lack of the concept of natural causes an imaginary psychology nothing but self misunderstandings , inter relations of pleasant or unpleasant general feelings , for example , the conditions of the nervous sympathies , with the help of the sign language of religion moral idiosyncrasy , repentance , remorse of conscience , temptation by the devil , presence of God an imaginary teleology the kingdom of God , the last judgement , everlasting life . <end>
<unchecked> <start> This purely fictitious world is , greatly to its disadvantage , the dream world , in that while the latter reflects actuality , the former falsifies , depreciated , and negatives it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> When once the concept of nature was devised as a concept antithetical to God , natural had to be the word for reprehensible that whole fact pious world has its root in hatred against the natural actuality ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> it is the expression of a profound faction with the actual . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But everything is explained thereby . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Who alone has reasons for lying himself out of actuality ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> He who suffers from it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But to suffer from actuality is to be an ill constituted actuality . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The preponderance of unpleasurable feelings over plea durable feelings is the cause of that fictitious mora city and religion : such a preponderance , however , furnishes the formula for decadence . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A criticism of the Christian concept of God compels us to the same conclusion . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A people which still believes in itself has withal its own God . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In him it references the conditions by which it is to the fore , its virtues it projects its delight in itself , its feeling of power , into a being who can be thanked for them . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He who is rich wishes to bestow a proud people needs a God in order to sacrifice . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Religion , within the limits of such presuppositions , is a form of gratitude . <end>
<unchecked> <start> One is thankful for one s self : for that purpose one needs a God . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Such a God must be able to be both service able and injurious , he must be able to be both friend and foe , he is admired alike in the good and in the bad . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The castration of a God to a God merely of the good would here be beyond the bounds of all desirability . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The bad God is as necessary as the good God for one does not owe one s existence to tolerance and humanitarianism . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What would a God be worth who did not know anger , rev , jealousy , scorn , craft , and violence ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> a God to whom , p . <end>
<unchecked> <start> aps not even the rapturous orders of triumph and an annihilation would be known ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> People would not under stand such a God : why should they have him ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> To be sure , when a people goes to ruin when it feels its belief in the future , and its hope of freedom finally vanish when it becomes conscious of submission as the first utility , and of the virtues of the submissive as conditions of maintenance , then its God also is obliged to change . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He now becomes a sneak , timid and modest , he counsels peace of soul , an end of hatred , indulgence , love even towards friend and foe . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He constantly moralists , he creeps into the cave of every private virtue , he becomes everybody s God , he becomes a private man , he becomes a cosmopolitan . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Formerly , he represented a people , the strength of a people , all that was aggressive and thirsty for power in the soul of a people now he is merely the good God . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In fact , there is no other alternative for Gods they are either the will to power and so long they will be national Gods , or else the impotence to power and then they necessarily become good . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Wherever the will to power declines in any way , there is always also a physiological retrogression , a decadence . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The v of decadence , pruned of his r ancient virtues and impulses , henceforth becomes ne necessarily the God of the physiologically retrograde , the weak . <end>
<unchecked> <start> They do not call themselves the weak , they call themselves the good . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is obvious , without a further hint being necessary in what mo meets in history only , the dualistic fiction of a good and a bad God became possible . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Through the same instinct by which the subjugated lower their God to the good in itself , they obliterate the good qualities out of the God of their conquerors they take revenge on their masters by their God . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The good God , just like the devil : both are abortions of dec. <end>
<unchecked> <start> hence . <end>
<unchecked> <start> How can one still defer so much to the sim publicity of Christian theologians , as to decree with them that the continuous development of the concept of God from the God of Israel , from the national God to the Christian God , to the essence of every thing good , is a progress ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> But so does even Renan . <end>
<unchecked> <start> As if Renan had a right to simplicity ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is just the very opposite that strikes the eye . <end>
<unchecked> <start> When the presuppositions of ascending life , when everything strong , brave , domineering , and proud have been eliminated out of the concept of God , when he sinks step by step to the symbol of a staff for the fat sued , a sheet anchor for all drowning ones , when he becomes the poor people s God , the sinners God , the God of the sick par excellence , and when the predicate of Saviour , Redeemer , is left as the sole divine predicate : what does such a change speak of ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> such a reduction of the divine ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> To be sure , the kingdom of God has thereby become greater . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Formerly , he had only his people , his chosen people . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Since then he has gone abroad on his travels , quite like his people itself , since then he has never again settled down quietly in any place : until he has finally become at home every where , the great cosmopolitan , till he has gained over the great number , and the half of earth to his side . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But the God of the great number , the democrat among Gods , became , nevertheless , no proud pagan God : he remained a Jew , he remained the God of the nooks , the God of all dark corners and places , of all unhealthy quarters throughout the world ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> His world empire is still , as formerly , an under world empire , a hospital , a subterranean empire , a Ghetto empire . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And he himself so pale , so weak , so decadent . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Even the palest of the pale still became master over him , Messieurs the metaphysician , the conceptual albinos . <end>
<unchecked> <start> They spun round about him so long , until , hypnotised by their movements , he became a cobweb spinner , a metaphysician himself . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Henceforth he spun the world anew out of himself sub specie Spmozce , henceforth he transfigured himself always into the thinner and the paler , he became ideal , he became pure spirit , he became absolute , he became thing in itself . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Ruin of a God : God became thing in itself . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The Christian concept of God God as God of the sick , God as cobweb spinner , God as spirit is one of the most corrupt concepts of God ever arrived at on earth it represents perhaps the gauge of low water in the descending development of the God type . <end>
<unchecked> <start> God degenerated to the contradiction of life , instead of being its transfiguration and its eternal yea ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> In God , hostility announced to life , to nature , to the will to life ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> God as the formula for every calumny of this world , for every lie of another world ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> In God nothingness deified , the will to nothingness declared holy ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> That the strong races of Northern Europe have not thrust from themselves the Christian God is verily no honour to their religious talent , not to speak of their taste . <end>
<unchecked> <start> They ought to have got the better of such a sickly and decrepit product of decadence . <end>
<unchecked> <start> There lies a curse upon them , because they have not got the better of it : they have incorporated sick ness , old age and contradiction into all their instincts , they have created no God since ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Two millenniums almost , and not a single new God ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> But still continuing , and as if persisting by right , as an ultimatum and maximum of the God shaping force , of the creator spirits in man , this pitiable God of Christian monotony theism ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> This hybrid image of ruin , derived from nullity , concept and contradiction , in which all de cadence instincts , all cowardice and lassitude of soul have their sanction ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> With my condemnation of Christianity , I should not like to have done an injustice to a kindred religion , which even in the number of its followers , to Buddhism . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The two are related as nihilistic religions they are decadence religions , both are separated from one another in the most re remarkable manner . <end>
<unchecked> <start> For the fact that they can now be compared the critic of Christianity is profoundly grateful to the Indian scholars . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Buddhism is a hundred times more realistic than Christianity , it has in its nature the heritage of an objective and cool pro pounding of questions , it arrives after a philo phial movement lasting hundreds of years the con cept of God is already done away with when it arrives . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Buddhism is the only properly positivist re legion which history sho vs us , even in its theory of perception a strict phenomenalism it no longer speaks of a struggle against sin , but , quite doing justice to actuality , it speaks of a struggle against suffering . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It has this distinguishes it profoundly from Christianity the self deception of moral concepts behind it it stands , in my language , beyond good and evil . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The two physiological facts on which it rests and which it has in view are , on the one hand , an ex massive of sensibility , which expresses itself as a refined capacity for pain , and , on the other hand , an over , an over long occupation with concepts and logical procedures through which the personal instinct has received damage to the ad vantage of the impersonal both are conditions , which at least some of my readers , the objective , will know , like myself , by experience . <end>
<unchecked> <start> On the basis of these physiological conditions a depression has originated : against which Buddha takes hygienic measures . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He applies life in the open air as a mean ure against it , wandering life moderation and selection in food precaution against all intoxicants similarly pre cautions against all emotions which create bile , or heat the blood no anxiety either for self or for others . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He requires notions which either give repose or gaiety , he devises means to one s self from others . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Fie understands goodness , benignity , as health promoting . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Prayer is excluded like asceticism no categorical im operative , no compulsion at all , not even within the monastic community a person can leave it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> These would all be means to strengthen that excessive . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Just on that account he does not require either a struggle against those who think differently his doctrine resists nothing so much as the feeling of reverse , of aversion , of resentment hostility does not come to an end by hostility : the moving refrain of the whole of Buddhism . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And rightly so : these very emotions would be extremely salutary in respect to the main regional purpose . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The intellectual fatigue which he lights upon , and which is expressed in an over great objectivity that is , weakening of india visual interest , loss of weight , of egotism , he combats . <end>
<unchecked> <start> by strictly reckon ducting even the most intellectual interests back to the individual . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In the doctrine of Buddha egotism became duty : the one thing needful , the how art thou freed from suffering , regulated and determined the whole intellectual regimen one may perhaps call to one s mind that Athenian who likewise waged war against pure , Socrates , who elevated personal egotism to morality even in the domain of problems . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The pre requisite for Buddhism is a very mild cli mate , great gentleness and liberality in usages , no militarism , and that it is the higher and learned classes in whom the movement has its focus . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Cheer fullness , tranquility and non desire are wanted as the highest goal , and the goal is attained . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Buddhism is not a religion in which perfection is merely aspired after : the perfect is the normal case . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In Christianity the instincts of the subjugated and suppressed come into the foreground : it is the lowest classes who here seek their goal . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Here the casuistry of sin , self criticism and inquisition of conscience are practised as occupations , as expedients against here the emotion towards a powerful one , called God , is constantly maintained by prayer here the highest is regarded as unattainable , as . <end>
<unchecked> <start> a . <end>
<unchecked> <start> gift , as grace . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Here also publicity is lacking : the hiding place , the dark chamber are Christian . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Here the body is despised , hygiene is repudiated as sensuousness the Church resists even cleanliness the first Christian regulation , after the expulsion of the Moors , was the closing of the public baths , of which Cordova alone possessed . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A certain sense of cruelty to wards self and others is Christian the hatred against those thinking differently the will to persecute . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Gloomy and exciting concepts are in the foreground the most greatly coveted states , designated with the highest names , are states the regimen is so chosen that it favours morbid phenomena and over excites the nerves . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The deadly hostility against the lords of the earth , the noble and at the same time a concealed , secret competition with them one leaves them the body , one only wants the soul are Christian . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The hatred of intellect , of pride , courage , freedom , of intellect , is Christian : the hatred of the senses , of the delights of the senses , of all delight , is Christian . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Christianity , when it left its first soil , the lowest classes , the underworld of the ancient world , when it went abroad among the barbarian nations in quest of power , had no longer to presuppose fatigued men , but internally savage , self lacerating men strong but ill constituted men . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The of man with himself , the suffering from himself , is not here an ex massive and capacity for pain , as it is in the case of Buddhists but reverse is an over power ful longing for ca ls ng pain , for discharging the inner tension in hostile actions and concepts . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Christianity had need of barbarous notions and values in order to become master of barbarians such are the sacrifice of , the blood drinking at the communion , the contempt of intellect and of culture torture in all its forms corporeal and incorporeal the great pomp of worship . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Buddhism is a religion for late men , for kind , gentle races who have become over intellectual and feel pain too readily Europe is as yet far from being ripe for it : it is a conveyance of them back to peace and cheer fullness , to regimen in intellectual matters , to a certain hardening in corporeal matters . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Christianity desires to become master of beasts of prey its expedient is to make them sick weakening is the Christian recipe for taming , for civilisation . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Buddhism is a religion for the close and the worn out ness of civilisation which Christianity does not as yet find in existence but which it may establish under certain conditions . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Buddhism , to repeat once more , is a hundred times colder , sincere and more objective . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It no longer needs to make its suffering , its capacity for pain , decent by the interpretation of sin , it says simply what it thinks , I suffer . <end>
<unchecked> <start> For the barbarian , on the contrary , suffer ing in itself is no decent thing : he needs first an ex planation in order to confess to himself that he suffers his instinct points him rather to the denial of suffering , to silent endurance . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Here the word devil was a : God send : people had an over powerful and terrible enemy , they did not need to be ashamed of suffering from such an enemy . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Christianity has some refinements at its basis which belong to the Orient . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Above all , Christianity knows that it is quite indifferent if aught is true , but of the highest importance so far as it is believed to be true . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Truth , and the belief that aught is true : two worlds with entirely exclusive interests , almost antithetical worlds , one arrives at each of the two by fund mentally different paths . <end>
<unchecked> <start> To be aware of this , makes almost a wise man in the Orient : it is thus that Brahmins understand it , it is thus that Plato under stands it , it is thus that every scholar of esoteric wisdom understands it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> When , for example , it is a happiness for a person to believe himself saved from sin , it is not necessary , as a pre requisite thereto , that he be sinful , but only that he feel himself sinful . <end>
<unchecked> <start> When however belief is necessary above everything else , reason , per caption , and investigation must be brought into discredit : the way to truth becomes a forbidden way . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Strong hope is a far greater stimulus to life than any single , actually occurring happiness . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Sufferers must be main gained by a hope which cannon be contradicted by any actuality , which is not done away with by a fulfilment : an other world hope . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Just on account of this capability of keeping the unfortunate person in suspense , hope was regarded among the Greeks as the evil of evils , as the peculiarly insidious evil : it remained behind in the box of evil . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In order that love may be possible , God must be a person in order that the lowest in stints may have a voice , God must be young . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is necessary for the fervour of women tg move . <end>
<unchecked> <start> handsome saint into the foreground , for the fervour of men a Mary . <end>
<unchecked> <start> This , of course , on the presupposition that Christianity desires to become master on a soil where aphrodisiac or Adonis worships have already determined the concept of worship . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The requirement of chastity strengthens the vehemence and internality of religious instinct it makes worship warmer , more enthusiastic , more soul breathing . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Love is the state in which man sees things most widely different from what they are . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Illusory power is there at its height , like sweetening and power . <end>
<unchecked> <start> One endures more in love than at other times , one puts up with everything . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The problem was to devise a religion in which it was possible to love : with that one is beyond the worst ills of life one no longer sees them . <end>
<unchecked> <start> So much concerning the three Christian virtues , faith , hope , and charity : I call them the three Christian shrewdness . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Buddhism is too late , too positivist to be still shrewd in this manner . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I only touch here on the problem of the origin of Christianity . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The first sentence for its solution is : Christianity can only be understood if one under stands the soil out of which it has grown , it is not a counter movement to Jewish instinct , it is rather the logical consequence of it , a further inference in its awe inspiring logic . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In the formula of the Redeemer : salvation is of the Jews . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The second principle : the psychological type of the Galilean is still recognisable , but only in its complete degeneration which at the same time is mutilation and an overloading with foreign traits could it serve the purpose for which it has been used , to be the type of a Redeemer of mankind . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The Jews are the most remarkable people in the history of the world , because , when confronted with the question of being or not preferred , with a perfectly weird consciousness , being at any price : this price was the radical , jo , aU nature L of all naturalness , of all actuality , of the entire inner world as well as the outer . <end>
<unchecked> <start> They demarcated their position counter to all conditions under which hitherto a people could live , was permitted to live they created out of themselves a concept antithetical to the natural conditions , they successively reversed , in an irreparable manner , religion , worship , morality , history , and psychology , into the contradiction of their natural values . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We meet with the same phenomenon once more , and in ineffable magnified proportions , al though only as a copy : the Christian church , in comparison with the saintly people , dispenses with all pretensions to originality . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The Jews , just on that account , are the most fatal nation in the history of the world : in their after effect they made mankind false to such an extent that Christian can even at present cherish . <end>
<unchecked> <start> ai anita Je wish feeling jwidiouFcomprehending that he is the ultimate consequence of Judaism . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I have brought forward psychologically for the first time , in my Genealogy of Morals , the antithetical concepts of a noble morality and of a resentment morality , the latter originated out of a negation of the former : but this is Jewish Christian morality wholly and entirely . <end>
<unchecked> <start> To be able to negative all that represents the ascending movement of life on earth , well , power , beauty , self affirmation , the instinct of resentment , developed to genius , had here to devise for itself another world , from which the affirmation of life appeared as the evil , as the reputable in itself . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Psychologically re examined , the Jewish people is a people of the toughest . <end>
<unchecked> <start> vital force . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Placed under impossible conditions , voluntarily , out of a most profound policy of self maintenance , it took the part of all decadence instincts , not as ruled by them , but because it divined in them a power by which to get along in opposition to the world . <end>
<unchecked> <start> They are the counterpart of all decadent : they were compelled to cxJiibit them to illusion , they have , with a non plus ultra of theatrical genius , known how to place themselves at the head of all decadence move meets as the Christianity of Paul , and have created something out of them which is stronger than any party affirmative of life . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Decadence , for the class of men who aspired to power in Judaism and Christian it a priestly class , is but a means this class of men has a vital interest in making mankind sick , and in reversing the concepts good and bad , true and false into a mortally dangerous and signification . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The history of Israel is invaluable as a typical history of the naturalising of natural values I indicate five matters of fact in this process . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Originally , and above all in the time of the kingdom , Israel like other people stood in the right relation , i . <end>
<unchecked> <start> e . <end>
<unchecked> <start> in the natural relation to all things . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Their javed was the expression of consciousness of power , the delight in themselves , the hope of themselves : in him they ex pecked victory and prosperity , with him they had con evidence in nature , that it would furnish what they needed above all , rain . <end>
<unchecked> <start> javed is the God of Israel , and consequently the God of justice : the logic of every people that is in power and has a good conscience thereof . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In the festal worship both these sides of of a people are expressed : it is thankful for the great destinies by which it came to the fore it is thankful in relation to the course of the year and all the good fortune in cattle rearing and agriculture . <end>
<unchecked> <start> This state of things continued for a long time , even when , in a sad manner , it was done away with : anarchy within and the Assyrian from without . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But the people firmly retained , as their highest desire ability , the vision of a king who w T as a good soldier and a strict judge : above all that typical prophet i . <end>
<unchecked> <start> e . <end>
<unchecked> <start> critic and satirist of the hour , Isaiah . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But every hope remained unrealised . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The old God could no longer do what he formerly could . <end>
<unchecked> <start> They might have to let him go . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What happened ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> They changed his concept , they naturalised his concept : they held him fast at that price . <end>
<unchecked> <start> javed , the God of justice , no longer a unity with Israel , an expression of national pride : only a God under conditions . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The concept of God becomes an instrument in the hands of priestly agitators , who henceforth interpret all good fortune as reward , all misfortune as punish ment for disobedience to God , for sin : that most falsified manner of interpretation of a pretended moral order of the world with which , once for all , the natural concepts of cause and effect are turned upside down . <end>
<unchecked> <start> As soon as natural causality by means of reward and punishment has been done away with , an causality is needed : all the rest of then follows . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A God who demands , in place of a God who helps , who surmount difficulties , who is , after all , the word for every happy inspiration of courage and self confidence . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Morality , no longer the expression of the conditions of the life and growth of a people , no longer its fundamental instinct of life , but become abstract , the antithesis of life , Morality as a fundamental debasement of phantasy , as evil eye for everything . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What is Jewish , what is Christian morality ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Chance despoiled of its innocence misfortune fouled with the concept of sin well being as danger , as temptation bad physiological condition poisoned by the serpent of conscience . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The concept of God falsified the concept of moral it falsified : the Jewish priesthood did not remain at rest there . <end>
<unchecked> <start> They could make no use of the whole history of Israel : away with it ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> These priests brought about that miracle of falsification the document of which lies before us in a good part of the Bible : with an unequalled scorn of every tradition , of every historical reality , they translated the past of their own people into the religious that is , they made out of it a stupid salvation mechanism of offence against javed and punishment , of piety towards javed and reward . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We should feel this most disgraceful act of historical falsification much more painfully , if the ecclesiastical interpretation of the history of millenniums had not almost blunted us to the requirement of uprightness in his tor ids . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And the philosophers seconded the church : the lie of a moral order of the world goes whole development even of modern philosophy . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What does a moral order of the world signify ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> That there is once for all a will of God , as to what men have to do and what they have not to do that the value of a people , or of an individual is determined by how much or how little the will of God is obeyed that in the destinies of a people , or of an individual , the will of God is demonstrated as ruling i . <end>
<unchecked> <start> e . <end>
<unchecked> <start> as punishing and rewarding in proportion to obedience . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The reality in place of this pitiable lie is that a para site species of man , the priests , who only nourish at the cost of all sound formations of life , misuse the name of God : they call a condition of things in which the priest determines the value of things , the king dom of God they call the means by which such a condition is attained or maintained the will of God with a cold blooded cynicism , they estimate peoples , ages , and individuals , according as they were service able to the priestly ascendency , or resisted it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let us see them at work : under the hands of Jewish priests the great period in the history of Israel became a period of decay the exile , the long misfortune was transformed into an eternal punishment for the great period a period in which as yet the priest was nothing . <end>
<unchecked> <start> According to their requirement , they made miserable sneaking creatures and hypocrites , or ungodly per sons out of the powerful and very freely constituted characters in the history of Israel , they simplified the psychology of every great event into the idiotic formula , obedience or disobedience to God . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A step further : the will of God , i . <end>
<unchecked> <start> lt ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> the conditions of maintenance for the power of the priest , must be known , for this purpose a revelation is needed . <end>
<unchecked> <start> e . <end>
<unchecked> <start> a great literary forgery becomes necessary , a holy book is discovered , it is made public with all hieratic pomp , with fast days and cries of lamentation for the long sin . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The will of God was fixed for ever so long , the whole evil lay in the fact that people had estranged themselves from the holy book . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Moses was al ready the revealed will of God . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What had happened The priest , with seventy and with pedantry , had once for all formulated what he wanted to have , what is the will of God , even to the great and the small imports which had to be paid to him not to forget the most savoury pieces of flesh , for the priest is a beefsteak eater . <end>
<unchecked> <start> From henceforth all the affairs of life are so regulated that the priest is every where indispensable at all natural events of life , at birth , at marriage , in sickness , at death , not to speak of the sacrifice the meal , the holy parasite appears , in order to naturalise them in his language , to sanctify them . <end>
<unchecked> <start> For that must comprehended : every natural custom , every natural institution the state , the administration of justice , marriage , the care of the sick and the poor , every requirement prompted by the instinct of life , everything , in short , that has its value in itself is , as a principle , made worthless , in apical to any value , by the parasitism of the priest or of a moral order of the world , it has need of a supplementary sanction , a value bestowing power is necessary , which denies naturalness therein , which just thereby creates value . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The priest depreciated , desecrated naturalness : it is only at this cost that he exists at all . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Disobedience to God , i . <end>
<unchecked> <start> e . <end>
<unchecked> <start> to the priest , to law now gets the name of sin the means for a person reconciling him again to God , as is only fair , are means by which the subjugation under the priest is only more thoroughly guaranteed : the priest alone saves . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Re examined psychologically , sins are indispensable in every society priestly organised : they are the real handles of power , the priest lives by the sins , it is needful for him that there should be sin king . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Principal proposition : God forgives him who does penance , e . <end>
<unchecked> <start> him who submits himself to the priest . <end>
<unchecked> <start> On a soil , falsified to that extent where all natural ness , every natural value , all reality , had the profoundest instincts of the ruling class opposed to it , Christianity grew up , a form of mortal hostility to reality which has not hitherto been surpassed . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The holy people who had maintained only priestly values , only priestly words , for all matters , and who , with a of conclusion which may inspire awe , had separated from themselves everything of power besides that existed on earth , as from the unholy , the world , sin , this people produced for its instinct a final formula which was logical to the point of self negation : as Christianity , it negatived even the last form of reality , the holy people , the chosen people , Jewish reality itself . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The case is of the first rank : the small seditious movement which is christened by the name of Jesus of Nazareth , is the Jewish instinct once more , expressed in other terms , the priestly instinct , which no longer endures the priest as a reality , the invention of a yet more abstract form of existence , a yet more unreal vision of the world , than is determined by the organisation of a church . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Christianity negatives the church . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I fail to see what the uprising was directed against , as the originator of which Jesus has been understood or misunderstood , if it was not an uprising against the Jewish church , the word church taken precisely in the sense in which we at present take it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It was an uprising against the good and just , against the saints of Israel , against the hierarchy of society not against its corruption but against caste , privilege , order , formula , it was the unbelief in higher men , the denial of all that was priest and theologian . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But the hierarchy which was thereby , though but for an instant , called in question , was the pile work , on which alone the Jewish people continued in the midst of the waters , the acquired last possibility of being left , the residuum of its detached political exist once an attack upon it was an attack upon the profoundest national instinct , upon the toughest national will to life which has ever existed on earth . <end>
<unchecked> <start> This holy anarchist who incited the lowest class , the out casts and sinners , the Chandalas within Judaism , to opposition against the ruling order with language which , if the Gospels can be trusted , would even at the present day send a person to Siberia , was a political criminal , so far as political criminals were possible in an absurdly unpolitical community . <end>
<unchecked> <start> This brought him to the cross : the proof of it is the in ascription on the cross . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He died for his guilt , all ground is lacking for the assertion however often it has been made , that he died for the guilt of others . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is quite another question whether he was at all conscious of a contrast of that kind , whether he was not merely felt to be such a contrast . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And it is but here that I touch on the problem of the psychology of the Saviour . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I confess that I read few books with such diffi cultins as the Gospels . <end>
<unchecked> <start> These difficulties are other than those in whose indication the learned curiosity of German intellect has celebrated one of its most me morale triumphs . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The time is far distant when I with the sage dullness of a refined philologist , like every young scholar , tasted thoroughly the work of the in comparable Strauss . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I was then twenty years of age : I am now too serious for that . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Of what account are the contradictions of tradition to me ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> How can legends of saints be called tradition at all ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> The stories of saints are the most ambiguous literature that exists : to apply scientific methods to it when no documents besides have reached us , appears to me con damned in principle mere learned idling . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What is of account to vie is the psychological type of the Saviour . <end>
<unchecked> <start> For it might be contained in the Gospels , in spite of the Gospels , however much it might be mutilated or overloaded with strange features : as that of Francis of Assisi is contained in his legends , in spite of the legends . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Not the truth with regard to what he did or said , or how he died exactly but the question whether his type is at all presentable now , whether it is handed down to us . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The attempts with which I am acquainted to pick out of the Gospels even the history of a soul , seem to me to be proofs of a detestable psychological frivolity . <end>
<unchecked> <start> M . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Renan , a buffoon in psychologies , got the two most inappropriate concepts imaginable , into his explanation of the type of Jesus , the concept of genius and the concept of hero heros . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But if anything be evangelical it is the concept of hero . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Just the antithesis to all contending , to all feeling one s self in struggle has here become instinct , the incapacity for resistance here becomes morality resist not evil : the profoundest saying of the Gospels , in a certain sense , the key to them , blessed ness in peace , in gentleness , in inability to be hostile . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What is glad tidings ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> True life , eternal life has been found it is not promised , it is there , it is in you : as life in love , in love without abatement , and exemption , without distance . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Everyone is the child of God Jesus does not at all claim anything for himself alone , as a child of God everyone is equal to everyone else . <end>
<unchecked> <start> To make a hero out of Jesus ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> And to think what a misunderstanding is the word genius ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Our whole concept of intellect , our cultured concept of it , has no meaning at all in the world in which Jesus lived . <end>
<unchecked> <start> If one would speak with the rigidity of the physiologist , quite another word would be the thing here . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We know a con edition of morbid excitability of the sense of touch in which the latter shrinks back in horror from every contact , from every seizing of a firm object . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let such a physiological habitus be translated into its ultimate logic as an instinctive hatred against every reality as a flight into the unintelligible , into the in comprehensible as an aversion from every formula , every concept of time and space , against all that is firmly established , custom , institution , church as feeling at home in a world with which no mode of reality is any longer in touch , in a merely inner world , a true world , an eternal world . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The kingdom of God is within you . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The instinctive hatred of reality : consequence of an extreme liability to suffering and excitement , which no longer wants to be touched at all , because it feels all contact too profoundly . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The instinctive exclusion of all antipathy , of all hostility , of all sentiment of limits and distances : con sequence of an extreme liability to suffering and ex excitement , which feels every resistance on its own part , every necessity for resistance as an intolerable dis pleasure , e . <end>
<unchecked> <start> as injurious , as dissuaded by instinct , and which knows blessedness delight only in no longer offering opposition , to any one either to the ill or to the evil , love as sole , as final possibility of life . <end>
<unchecked> <start> These are the two physiological realities upon which , out of which the salvation doctrine has grown . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I call them a sublime , extended development of heron ism on a thoroughly morbid basis . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Although with a large addition of Greek vitality and nerve force , pi cubism , the salvation doctrine of Paganism , remains most closely related to it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Epicurus , a typical dec. <end>
<unchecked> <start> dent : first recognised by me as such . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The fear of pain , even of the infinitely small in pain , it cannon end otherwise than as a religion of love . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I have given beforehand my answer to the pro blew . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The pre requisite for it is that the type of the Saviour be but preserved to us in a strong distortion . <end>
<unchecked> <start> This distortion has in itself much probability : such a type could not for several reasons remain pure , entire or free from additions . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The milieu in which this strange character moved must have made its marks upon it , as the history , the fate of the first Christian community must have done still more : by that fate the type was reciprocally enriched with traits which only become comprehensible by warfare , and by the purposes of propaganda . <end>
<unchecked> <start> By that strange and sickly world into which we are introduced by the Gospels a world as if taken from a Russian novel in which the outcasts of society , nervous affections and childish idiots , seem to have appointed a render vous the type must under all circumstances have been rendered coarser : the first disciples , especially , translated an essence swimming entirely in symbols and into their own crudity in order to understand anything of it at all , for them the type was only existent after having been pressed into better known forms . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The prophet , the Messiah , the future judge , the moral teacher , the , John the Baptist just so many opportunities for mis taking the type . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Finally let us not undervalue the propria of all great veneration , especially sect arian veneration : it extinguished the original and often painfully alien characteristics and idiosyncrasies in the venerated being it does not see trevi itself . <end>
<unchecked> <start> One has to regret that a dostoievsky has not lived in the neighbourhood of this most interesting decadent , I mean some one who knew just how to perceive the thrilling charm of such a mixture of the sublime , the sickly and the childish . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A last point of view : the type , as a decadence type , could actually have been of a peru liar plurality and contradictoriness : such a possibility is not completely to be excluded . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Nevertheless everything dissuades therefrom : tradition above all would have to be remarkably true and objective in this case , of which we have reasons for supposing the contrary . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In the meanwhile there yawns a con tradition between the mountain , lake , and meadow preacher whose appearance impresses one like that of a Buddha on a soil very unlike that of India , and the fanatical aggressor , the deadly enemy of theologians and priests , whom Kenan s malice has glorified as le grand maitre en ironic . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I myself do not doubt that the profuse amount of gall and even of esprit has only overflowed upon the type of the master out of the excited condition of Christian propaganda : one knows well the of all nectaries to shape their master into an apology of themselves . <end>
<unchecked> <start> When the first community had need of a ensuring , wrangling , wrathful , maliciously subtle theologian ink opposition to theologians , they created their God occur ding to their need : as they also , without hesitation , put into his mouth those completely evangelical concepts which they could not then do without the second coming , the last judgment , every kind of temporal expectation and promise . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I resist , let it be said once more , the introducing of the fanatic into the type of the Saviour : the very word imperious which Renan used annulled the type . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The good tidings are just that there are no more antitheses the kingdom of heaven belongs to children the faith whose voice is heard here is not a faith acquired by struggle , it is there , it is from the be winning , it is , as it were , a which has flowed back into the intellectual . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The case of retarded puberty undeveloped in the organism , as a phenomenon resulting from degeneration , is at least familiar to physiologists . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Such a belief is not angry , it does not find fault , it does not offer resistance it does not bring the sword , it has no idea in what respect it might some day separate people . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It does not prove itself either by miracles or by reward and promise , or even by the Scripture : it is every moment its own miracle , its own reward , its own proof , its own kingdom of God . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Neither does this belief formulate itself it lives , it resists formulae . <end>
<unchecked> <start> To be sure , the accident of environment , of language , of schooling , determines a certain circle of concepts : primitive Christianity uses only Jewish Semitic concepts the eating and drinking at the communion belong here , those concepts , so badly misused by the Church , like everything Jewish . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But let us be careful not to see therein anything more than a symbolic speech , a semiotic , an opportunity for similes . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is precisely the preliminary condition of this anti realist being able to speak at all , that not a single word is taken literally . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Among the Indians , he would have made use of the sandham concepts among the Chinese , he would have made use of those of Lao tse and would have felt no difference thereby . <end>
<unchecked> <start> One might , with some tolerance of expression , call Jesus a free spirit he does not care a bit for anything fixed : the word killed , all that is fixed killed . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The concept , the experience of life as he alone knows it , is with him repugnant to every kind of expression , formula , law , belief , or dogma . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He speaks merely of the inmost things : life , or truth , or light , are his ex sessions for the inmost things , everything else , the whole of reality , the whole of nature , language itself , has for him merely the value of a sign , or a simile . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Here , one must take care not to mistake anything , however great the seduction may be which lies in Christian , e . <end>
<unchecked> <start> in ecclesiastical prejudice . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Such a sum holism par excellence stands outside of all religion , all concepts of w r worship , all history , all natural science , all experience of the world , all knowledge , all politics , all psychology , all books , all art the knowledge of Jesus is just the pure folly that there should be any thing of that kind . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Civilisation is not even known to him by hearsay , he has no need of any struggle against it he does not negative it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The same is true of the state , of the whole civil order and society , of labour , of war he has never had any reason to negative the world , he has never had any idea of the ecclesiastical concept of the world . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Negation is just what is quite impossible for him . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Dialectics is similarly lacking , it lacks the notion that a belief , a truth , could be proved by reasons his proofs are internal lights , internal feelings of delight , and self affirmations , nothing but proofs of force . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Such a doctrine is not even able to contradict , it does not even conceive that there are other doctrines , that there can be other doctrines , it does not even know how to represent to itself an opposite mode of thinking . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Where such is met with , the former will mourn concerning blind ness from heartiest sympathy for it sees the light , but it will make no objection . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In the entire psychology of the gospel the concepts of guilt and punishment are lacking similarly the concept of reward . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Sin , every relation of distance between God and man , is done away with , it is just that which is the glad tidings . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Blessedness is not promised , it does not depend on conditions : it is the sole reality the rest is symbolism for speak ing of it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The consequence of such a condition projects itself into a new practice , the truly evangelical practice . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is not a belief which distinguishes the Christian : the Christian acts , he distinguishes himself by another mode of acting . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In that he does not offer resistance either by word or in heart to those acting in a hostile way towards him . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In that he makes no distinction between foreigners and natives , between Jews and not Jews the neighbour , properly , the fellow believer , the Jew . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In that he does not get angry at any one , does not despise any one . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In that he neither lets himself be seen in the law courts , nor takes their claims into account not swearing . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In that , undergo circumstances , does he separate from his wife , not even in the case of her proved unfaithfulness . <end>
<unchecked> <start> All fundamentally one proposition , all the consequences of one instinct The life of the Saviour was nothing else but this practice , neither was his death anything else . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He had no need of any formulae or rites for inter course with God not even of prayer . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He has settled accounts with the whole of the Jewish expiation and reconciliation doctrine he knows that it is by the practice of life alone that one feels himself divine , blessed , evangelical , at all times a child of God . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Neither penitence , nor prayer for forgiveness God , is itself God . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What was abolished by the gospel , was the Judaism of the concepts of sin , forgiveness of sin , faith , salvation by faith , the entire Jewish ecclesiastical doctrine was negatived in the glad tidings . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The profound instinct for the problem how to live in order to feel one s self in heaven , to feel one s self eternal , while in every other relation one feels that one is not in the least in heaven : this alone is the psychological reality of salvation . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A new mode of conduct , not a new faith . <end>
<unchecked> <start> If I understand anything of this great symbolist , it is that he only took inner realities as realities , as truths that he only understood the rest , all that is natural , temporal , spatial , historical , as signs , as occasion for similes . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The concept of the Son of Man , is not a concrete person belonging to history , some individual , solitary case , but an eternal fact , a psychological symbol freed from the concept of time . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The same is again true , and true in the highest sense , of the God of this typical symbolist , of the kingdom of God , of the kingdom of heaven , the sonship of God . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Nothing is more un Christian than the ecclesiastical crudities of a God as a person , of a kingdom of God which copies , of a kingdom of heaven in another world , of a Son of God , the second person of the Trinity . <end>
<unchecked> <start> All that is forgive me the expression the fist in the eye oh , in what sort of an eye ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> of the gospel : historical cynicism in the mockery of the symbol . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But it is quite palpable what is touched upon by the figures of father and son not palpable for every one , I admit : by the word son the entrance into the collective sentiment of transfiguration of all things blessedness is express ed by the word father , this sentiment itself , the sentiment of and completeness . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I am sham ed to call to mind what the church has made out this symbolism : has it not placed an Amphitryon story at the threshold of Christian faith ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> And a dogma of immaculate conception over and above . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The kingdom of heaven is a state of the something which comes over the earth or after death . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The entire concept of natural death is lacking in the gospel : death is no bridge , no transition this concept is lacking , because it belongs to an en timely different world , which is merely apparent , merely useful to serve for symbolism . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The hour of death is no Christian concept , the hour , time , physical life and its crises , do not at all exist for the teacher of the glad tidings . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The kingdom of God is nothing which is expected , it has no yesterday and no day after to morrow , it does not come in a thousand years it is an experience in a heart it is every where present , it is nowhere present . <end>
<unchecked> <start> This bringer of glad tidings died as he lived , as he tangent not to save men , but to show how one ought to live . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is the practice which he left behind to mankind , his behaviour before the judges , before the victors , before his accusers , and in presence of every kind of calumny and mockery his behaviour on the cross . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He does not resist , he does not defend his right , he takes no step to avert from himself the extremest consequences yet more , he exacts them . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And he entreaty , he suffers , he loves with those , in those who do him wrong . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Not to defend himself , not to be angry , not to make answerable . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But not even to resist an evil one , to love him . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Only we , we emancipated spirits , have the pre requisite for understanding a thing which has been misunderstood by nineteen centuries , that uprightness , become instinctive and passionate , which makes war against the holy lie even more than against any other . <end>
<unchecked> <start> People were unspeakably far from our affectionate and prudent neutrality , from that discipline of intellect which alone makes it possible to find out such unfamiliar and delicate affairs : with an in solent selfishness , they always sought only their own advantage therein , they erected the church out of the antithesis to the gospel . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He who sought for signs that an ironical Divinity operated behind the great drama of the world , would find no small support in the stupendous question mark called Christianity . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That mankind should bow the knee before the antithesis of that which was the origin , the meaning and the right of the gospel , that they should have declared holy precisely those features in the concept of church we . <end>
<unchecked> <start> h the bringer of glad tidings regarded as bengal m , as behind him one would seek in vain fora grander form of grand historical irony . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Our age is proud of its his r i ca i sen e : how has it been able to make itself b i eve in the absurdity that the gross tJiauniatnrgist am redeemer fable stands at the commencement of Christi Ln it , and that every thing spiritual and symbolic i on ly a later develop ment ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> reverse : the histon o f Christianity and , of course , from the death or the cross onwards is the history of the gradually g , O user and grosser mis understanding of an original S symbolism . <end>
<unchecked> <start> With every extension of Christianity over s till broader , still ruder masses in whom the pre equis gg out of which it was born were more and more Backing , it became more necessary to vulgaris , to barbaric Christianity . <end>
<unchecked> <start> it has taken into itself doctrine es an d rites from all the subterranean cults of the . <end>
<unchecked> <start> p m Romanum , and the absurdity of all kinds . <end>
<unchecked> <start> f s i c key reason . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The fate of Christianity lay in the n , ece city that its faith itself had to become as sickly , gt as i o v and vulgar as the needs were sickly , low , anti . <end>
<unchecked> <start> vulgar which had to be gratified by it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> As church a , the sickly barbarism itself finally swells up into po ot wer ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> church , that form of deadly hostility to all uprightness , to all elevation of soul , to all discipline of intellect , to all ingenious and gracious humanity . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The Christian the noble values : it is only we , we emancipated spirits , who have re established this greatest of all antitheses of values ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> I do not suppress a sigh at this place . <end>
<unchecked> <start> There are days when I am visited by a feeling , blacker than the blackest melancholy contempt of man . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And that I may leave no doubt with regard to what I despise , whom I despise , it is the man of to day , the man with whom I am fatally contemporaneous . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The man of to day I suffocate from his impure breath . <end>
<unchecked> <start> With respect to what is past , I am , like all who per clive , of a great tolerance , e . <end>
<unchecked> <start> a generous self over coming . <end>
<unchecked> <start> With a gloomy circumspection I go through the madhouse world of entire millenniums it may be called Christianity , Christian faith , Christian church , I take care not to make mankind account able for its inanities . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But my feeling changes suddenly , and breaks out as soon as I enter the modern period , our period . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Our age knows . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What was formerly merely morbid , now has become unseemly , it is now unseemly to be a Christian . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And litre my loathing commences . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I look around me : there is no longer a word left of what was formerly called truth , we no longer endure it when a priest even takes the word truth into his mouth . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Even w r ith the most modest pretensions to uprightness , it must be known at present that a theologian , a priest , a pope , not only errs , but lies , with every sentence he speaks , that he is no longer at liberty to lie out of into hence , out of ignorance . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Even the priest knows as well as any one knows that there is no longer any God , any sinner , any Saviour that free will and a moral order of the world are lies : seriousness , the profound self surmounting of intellect , no longer allows anyone to be ignorant of these matters . <end>
<unchecked> <start> All concepts of the church have been recognised as what they are , as the wickedest of all forms of false coinage invented for the purpose of depreciating nature , natural values the priest himself has been recognised as what he is , as the most dangerous species of parasite , as the actual poison spider of life . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We know , our conscience knows to day what those sinister inventions of the priests and of the church are really worth , what pur pose was served by those inventions by which that state of self prostitution of mankind has been reached whose aspect can excite loathing the concepts , the other world , last judgment , immortality of soul , soul itself : they are torture instruments , they are systems of cruelty in virtue of which the priest became master , remained master . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Everybody knows that and nevertheless everything remains in the old way . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What happened to the last sentiment of seediness , of respect for ourselves , when our states men even , otherwise a very unbiased species of men , and practical Anti Christians through and through , call themselves Christians at the present day , and go to the communion ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> A prince at the head of his regiments , splendid as the expression of the selfishness and elation of his nation , but , without any shame , confessing himself a Christian ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Whom then does Christianity deny ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> what does it call the world ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> To be a soldier , a judge , a patriot to defend one s self to guard one s honour to seek one s advantage to be proud . <end>
<unchecked> <start> All practice of every hour , all in stints , all valuations realising themselves in deeds are at present Anti Christian : what a monster of falsity must modern man be that he nevertheless is not ashamed to be still called a Christian ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> I return , I repeat the genuine history of Christ vanity . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The very word Christianity is a minder standing in reality there has been only one Christian , and he died on the cross . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The evangelism died on the cross . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What was called evangelism from that hour onwards was already the antithesis of what he had lived : bad tidings , a Dysangelium . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is false to the verge of absurdity , to see in a belief perhaps in the belief of salvation through Christ the distinguishing mark of the Christian : Christian practice alone a life such as he who died on the cross lived is Christian . <end>
<unchecked> <start> At present such a life is still possible , for certain men it is even necessary : genuine , original Christianity will be possible at all times . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Not a believing but a doing , a not doing of many things , above all , a different existence . <end>
<unchecked> <start> For states of consciousness , or any kind of believing , a taking for granted , for example , as every psychologist knows , are quite indifferent and of the fifth rank in comparison with the value of instincts : more strictly expressed : the whole concept of intellectual causality is false . <end>
<unchecked> <start> To reduce the being a Christian , Christianness , to a taking for granted , to a mere phenomenally of consciousness , is to negative Christianness . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In fact there have never been Christians at all . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The Christian , what for two millenniums has been called a Christian , is merely a psychological self misunderstanding . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Looked at more closely , it was merely the instincts which dominated in the Christian in spite of all his belief and what kind of instincts ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Belief has been at all times for example with Luther only a cloak , a pretence , a curtain behind which the instincts played their game a shrewd blindness with regard to the dominance of certain instincts . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Belief I already called it the peculiar Christian shrewdness , people always spoke about their belief , but always acted merely from their instincts . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In the world of con cents of the Christian nothing is contained which is in touch w r ith actuality : on the other hand , we recognised in the instinctive hatred of all actuality , the motive element , the only motive element at the root of Christianity . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What follows therefrom ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> That here , in psychologies also , the error is radical , it is , it is substance . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A concept taken away here , a single reality put in its place and the whole of Christianity tumbles into nothingness ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Looked at from an elevation , this strangest of all facts , a religion not only determined by errors , but inventive and even ingenious only in injurious , in life poisoning and errors , is a spectacle for Gods for those Deities who are at the same time philosophers , and with whom I have met , for example , at those cele rated dialogues at Naxos . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In the hour when the loathing leaves them and us ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> they become thankful for the spectacle of the Christian : the miserable , small star called earth deserves , perhaps , a divine glance , divine sympathy alone on account of this curious case . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Do not let us undervalue the Christian : the Christian , false even to innocence , is far beyond the ape , in respect to the Christian a well known theory of de scent becomes a mere compliment . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The fate of the gospel was decided with the death , it hung on the cross . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It was only the death , the unexpected , disgraceful death , it was only the cross which in general was reserved for the camille alone , it was only this most awful paradox that brought the disciples face to face with the real enigma , Who was that ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> what was that ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> The feeling staggered and profoundly insulted the suspicion that such a death might be the refutation of their affair the fright ful question mark : Why just so ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> this condition is understood only too well . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Here everything had to be necessary , everything had to have significance , reason , loftiest reason . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The love of a disciple knows nothing of chance . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It was now only that the chasm opened up : Who killed him ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Who was his natural enemy ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> this question came like a flash of lightning . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Answer : Domineering Judaism , its upper class . <end>
<unchecked> <start> From that moment they felt themselves in revolt against the established order , they afterwards understood Jesus as in revolt against the established order . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Till then this combative characteristic , denying by word and deed , had been absent from his likeness nay more , he had been the antithesis of it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Evidently the little community did not understand just the main thing , in what respect an example was set by dying in this manner , the freedom , the superiority over every feeling of resentment : a sign how little they understood of him at all ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> In itself , Jesus could not wish aught by his death but to give publicly the strongest test , the demonstration of his doctrine . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But his disciples were far from forgiving this death which would have been evangelical in the highest sense , and were equally far from offering themselves to a similar death in gentle and charming repose of heart . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Just the most evangelical of feelings , revenge , again came to the fore . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It was deemed impossible that the affair could be at an end with this death : recompense , judgment was needed and yet , what can be more evangelical than recompense punishment , and sitting in judgment ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> The popular expectation of a Messiah came once more into the foreground an historical moment was seized by the eye : the king dom of God comes for the judgment of his enemies . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But everything is thereby misunderstood : the king dom of goal as a concluding act , as a promise ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> For the gospel had been precisely the existence , the ful ailment , the actuality of that kingdom . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Such a death was just precisely that kingdom of God . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It was now only that the whole of the contempt of , and bitterness against the Pharisees and theologians was introduced into the type of the master , he was thereby made a Pharisee and a theologian ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> On the other hand , the savaged reverence of these souls entirely disjointed did no longer endure the evangelical equal entitlement of everybody to be a child of God which Jesus had taught : their revenge was to elevate Jesus in an extravagant fashion , to sever him from themselves : quite in the same manner as the Jews had formerly separated their God from themselves and raised him aloft , for revenge on their enemies . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The One God , and the One Son of God : both products of r essential al cnt . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And from that time an absurd problem came to the surface : How could God permit that ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> With respect thereto the deranged reason of the little community found quite a frightfully absurd answer : God gave his Son for the forgiveness of sins , as a sacrifice . <end>
<unchecked> <start> How it w r as all at once at an end with the gospel ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> The sacrifice for guilt , and just in its most repugnant and barbarous form , the sacrifice of the innocent for the sins of the guilt T ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> What a horrifying heathenism ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> For Jesus had done away with the concept of guilt itself he denied that there vas any gulf between man and God , he lived this unity of God and man as his glad tidings . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And not as a privilege ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> From that time onwards the type of the Saviour is entered progressively by the doctrine of judgment and of the second coining , by the doctrine of death as a sacrificial death , and by the doctrine of resurrection , with which the whole concept of blessedness , the entire and sole reality of the gospel , is filched away in favour of a state after death ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Paul , with the rabbinical impudence which distinguishes him in every respect , has brought reason into this concept , this lewdness of a concept , in the follow ing way : If Christ hath not been raised from the dead your faith is vain . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And all at once there arose out of the gospel the most contemptible of all promises , the shameless doctrine of personal immortality . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Yet Paul himself taught it as a reward ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> One sees what came to an end with the death on the cross : a new , a thoroughly original commencement of a buddhist peace movement , of an actual and not merely promised happiness on earth . <end>
<unchecked> <start> For this remains I emphasised it before the fundamental distinction between the two decadence religions : Bud deism gives no promise but keeps every one , Christianity gives any promise , but keeps none . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The glad tidings were followed closely by the worst of all , those of Paul . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In Paul , the antithetical type of the bearer of glad tidings is personified , the genius in hatred , in the vision of hatred , in the relentless logic of hatred . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What all has been sacrificed to hatred by this ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Above all the Saviour : Paul nailed the Saviour to his own cross . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The life , the example , the teaching , the death , the significance , and the law of the entire gospel nothing more was left when this false corner by hatred conceived what he alone could use . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Not reality , not historical truth ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> And once more the priestly instinct of the Jew perpetrated the like great crime against history it simply stroked out the lester day , the day before yesterday of Christianity , it invented for itself a history of first Christianity . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Yet more : it falsified the history of Israel over again in order to make it appear as a history preliminary to its achievement : all prophets are now supposed to have spoken of its Saviour . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The church later false find even the history of mankind into a history pre luminary to Christianity . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The type of the Saviour , his teaching , his practice , his death , the significance of his death , even the sequel to his death nothing re gained untouched , nothing withal remained like the fact . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Paul simply shifted the centre of gravity of that whole existence behind this existence , into the lie of risen Jesus . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In truth he could not use the life of the Saviour at all , he needed the death on the cross , and something more besides . <end>
<unchecked> <start> To take as honest a Paul who had his home at the principal seat of Stoical enlightenment when he derives from a hallucination the proof that the Saviour is yet living or even to give credence to his account that he had had such a hallucination would be a genuine on the part of a psychologist : Paul willed the end , consequently he willed also the means . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What he himself did not believe , was believed by the idiots among whom he cast his teaching . <end>
<unchecked> <start> His require ment was power with Paul the priest strove once more for power , he could only use concepts , doc tries , symbols , with which one tyrannies over masses and forms herds . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What alone did Mohammed borrow later from Christianity ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> The invention of Paul , his expedient for priestly tyranny , for forming herds : the belief in immortality , e . <end>
<unchecked> <start> the doctrine of judgment . <end>
<unchecked> <start> When the centre of gravity of life is placed , not in life , but in the other world in nothingness life has in reality been deprived of its centre of gravity . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The great lie of personal immortality destroys all reason , all naturalness in instinct all that is beneficent , that is life furthering , that pledges for the future in in stints , henceforth excites mistrust . <end>
<unchecked> <start> So to live that it has no longer any significance to live , that now becomes the significance of life . <end>
<unchecked> <start> For what purpose social sentiment , for what purpose to be still grateful for descent and for forefathers , for what purpose to co operate , to trust , to further and have in view any general welfare ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Just so many temptations , just so many deviations from the right path One thing is needful . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That everyone , as an immortal soul , has equal rank with everyone else , that in the uni versatility of beings the salvation of every individual can lay claim to eternal importance , that little hypocrites and half crazed people dare to imagine that on their account the laws of nature are constantly broken such an enhancement of every kind of selfishness to infinity , to impudence , cannon be branded with sufficient contempt . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And yet Christianity owes its triumph to this pitiable flattery of personal vanity , it has thereby enticed over to its side all the ill constituted , the seditious disposed , the ill fortune , the whole scum and dross of humanity . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Salvation of the soul means , in plain words , the world revolves around me . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The poison of tha teaching of equal rights for all has been spread abroad by Christianity more than by anything else , as a matter of principle Christianity has , from the most secret recesses of bad instincts , waged a deadly war against every sentiment of reverence and distance between man and man , i . <end>
<unchecked> <start> e . <end>
<unchecked> <start> the pre requisite to every elevation , to every growth of civilisation , out of the resentment of the masses , it has forged for itself its principal weapon against us , against all that is noble , glad , and high hearted on earth , against our happiness on earth . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Immortality granted to every Peter and Paul , has hitherto been the worst , the most vicious outrage on noble humanity . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And let us not under estimate the calamity which , proceeding from Christianity , has insinuated itself even into politics . <end>
<unchecked> <start> At present nobody has any longer the courage for separate rights , for rights of domination , for a feeling of reverence for himself and his equals , for pathos of distance . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Our politics are morbid from this want of courage ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> The aristocracy of character has been undermined most craftily by the lie of equality of souls and if the belief in the privilege of the many makes revolutions and will continue to make them , it is Christianity , let us not doubt it , it is Christian valuations , which translate every revolution merely into blood and crime ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Christianity is a revolt of all that creeps on the ground against what is elevated : the gospel of the lowly makes low . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The gospels are invaluable as evidence of the in peasant corruption within the first congregation . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What later was carried to an end by Paul with the logical cynicism of a Rabbi , was , nevertheless , merely the pro cess of decay which began with the death of the Saviour . <end>
<unchecked> <start> These gospels cannon be read too guardedly : they have their difficulties behind every word . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I confess and I shall be pardoned for doing so that to the psychologist they are just thereby a pleasure of the first rank , as the antithesis to all naive depravity , as the refinement par excellence , as the artistic perfection in psychological depravity . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The gospels stand apart . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The Bible in general does not admit of comparison : One is among Jews : the chief point of view , so as not to lose all consistency . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The dissembling of one s self into holiness , here becoming downright genius and never having been attained even approximately at any other time , either in books or among men , this false coinage in words and attitudes , as an art , is not the accident of any individual endowment , of any exceptional nature . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Race is required for it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In Christianity , and its art of holy lying , Judaism entire , the most thoroughly earnest Jewish practice and technique of hundreds of years , attains its final masterless . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The Christian , this ultima ratio of the lie , is the Jew once more even three times . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The will to use , as a matter of principle , only concepts , symbols , and at attitudes which are established by the praxis of the priest , the instinctive repudiation of every other praxis , of every other mode of perspective with regard to value and utility that is not only tradition , it is in heritage : it is only as inheritance that it operates as nature . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The whole human race , the best minds of the best ages even one excepted , who is perhaps merely a monster , have been deceived . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The gospel has been read as the book of innocence . <end>
<unchecked> <start> no small indication of the masterless with which the game has been played here . <end>
<unchecked> <start> To be sure , if we should see them , only in passing , all these whimsical hypocrites and artificial saints , the end would have come , and precisely be cause I never read a word without perceiving attitudes . <end>
<unchecked> <start> make an end of them . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I cannon endure a cer tain way they have of opening their eyes . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Fortunately books are for most people mere literature . <end>
<unchecked> <start> One must not be misled : judge not , they say , but they send everything to hell which stands in their way . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In making God judge , they themselves judge in glorify ing God , they glorify themselves in demanding those virtues of which they happen to be capable yet more , which they need in order to get the better at all , they assume the grand airs of a wrestling for virtue , of a struggle for the triumph of virtue . <end>
<unchecked> <start> joe Jive , we die , we sacrifice ourselves for the good truth , light the kingdom of God : in fact , they do what they cannon leave undone . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In pressing themselves through all kinds of holes , in sitting in the corner , in living like shadows in the shade , after the manner of sneaking creatures , they make a duty out of it : their life in humility appears to be a duty , as humility , it is an additional proof of their piety . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Ah , this humble , chaste , charitable kind of falsehood ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> For us virtue itself shall bear witness . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let the gospels be read as books of seduction with morality : moral it is arrested by these wretched people , they know of what consequence morality is ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Mankind is best led by the nose with morality ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> The reality is that here the most conscious self conceit of tie elect plays the part of discretion : they have placed themselves , the congregation , the good and just , once for all on the one side , on the side of truth and the others , the world , on the other side . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That has been the most fatal species of ambitious mono mania which has hitherto existed on earth : wretched monsters of hypocrites and liars began to claim for themselves the concepts God , truth , light , spirit , love , wisdom , life , as If they were synonyms of them , in order to divide themselves thus by a boundary line from the world , wretched super natives of Jews , ripe for every kind of mad house , re versed the values altogether according to their own nature , as if only the Christian was the significance , the salt , the standard , and even the ultimate tribunal for all the rest . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The whole calamity became possible only by a cognate , technologically cognate species of ambitious , Jewish , being in the world : the gap between the Jews and the Jewish Christians once opened up , no choice at all remained to the latter except to apply . <end>
<unchecked> <start> the procedures for advised by Jewish instinct , against the Jews themselves , while the Jews had until then applied them only against all that was lt ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Jewish . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The Christian is but a Jew of freer confession . <end>

<unchecked> <start> For the purpose of understanding this passage , a document of the very first rank for the psychology of all chantal morality , the first essay of my Genealogy of Morals should be read : there for the first time the antithesis between a noble morality and a chantal morality born out of resentment and impotent revenge , was brought forward . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Paul was the greatest of all apostles of revenge . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What follows therefrom f That one does well to put on gloves when reading the New Testament . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The proximity of so much cleanliness almost compels one to do so . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We should as little choose first Christians for companionship as Polish Jews : not that even an objection was required against them . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Neither of them have a good smell . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I have searched in vain in the New Testament for even a single sympathetic trait . <end>
<unchecked> <start> There is nothing in it free , gra pious , open hearted , upright . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Humanity has not yet made its beginning here , the instincts of clean lines are lacking . <end>
<unchecked> <start> There are only bad instincts in the New Testament , there is no courage even for these bad instincts . <end>
<unchecked> <start> All in it is cowardice , all is shut ting of the eyes , and self deception . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Every book becomes cleanly , when one has just read the New Testament . <end>
<unchecked> <start> To give an example , immediately after Paul , I read with delight Petronius , that most charming and wan ton scoffed , of whom might be said what Domenico Boccaccio wrote to the Duke of Parma concerning Cesare Borgia : e tutti pesto immortal healthy , immortal cheerful and well constituted . <end>
<unchecked> <start> For these wretched hypocrites miscalculated in the main thing . <end>
<unchecked> <start> They attack , but everything that is attacked by them is thereby distinguished . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He who is attacked by a first Christian is not soiled , reverse : it is an honour to have first Christians for enemies . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The New Testament is not read without a predilection for that which is abused in it , not to speak of the wis dom of this world which an impudent boasted in vain sought to put to shame by a foolish sermon . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But even the Pharisees and scribes have an advantage from such antagonism : they must surely have been worth something to be hated in such an indecent manner . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Hypocrisy that is a reproach first Christians are allowed to make ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> In the end the Pharisees and scribes were the privileged : that suffices , the chantal hatred needs no further reasons . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The first Christian I fear also the last Christian , w iom I shall per has yet live to see is , by fundamental instinct , a rebel against everything privileged he lives for , he struggles always for equal rights ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Examined more exactly , he has no choice . <end>
<unchecked> <start> If one wants person ally to be one of the chosen of God or a temple of God , or a judge of angels every other pain simple of selection , for example according to uprightness , according to intellect , according to manliness and pride , according to beauty and freedom of heart , is simply world , the evil in itself . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Moral : every ex expression in the mouth of a first Christian is a lie , every action he does is an instinctive falsehood all his values , all his aims are injurious , but he whom he hates , that which he hates , has value . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The Christian , the priestly Christian especially , is a criterion of values . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Have I yet to say that in the whole New Testament , only a single figure appears which one is obliged to honour ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Pilate , the Roman governor . <end>
<unchecked> <start> To take a Jewish affair seriously he will not be persuaded to do so . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A Jew more or less what does that matter ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> The noble scorn of a Roman before whom a shameless misuse of the word truth was carried on has enriched the New Testament with the sole expression which has value , which is itself its criticism , its annihilation : What is truth ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> What separates us is not that we do not re discover any God , either in history or in nature , or behind nature , but that we recognise what was worshipped as God not as divine , but as pitiable , as absurd , as injurious not only as an error but as a crime against life . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We deny God as God . <end>
<unchecked> <start> If this God of the Christians were proved to us , we should still less know how to believe in him . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In a formula : Deus qualm Paulus credit , Dei negation . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A religion like Christianity , which is not in touch with actuality on any point , which immediately falls down as soon as actuality gets its right even in a single point , must , of course , be mortally hostile to the wisdom of the world , i . <end>

<unchecked> <start> Paul understood that the lie , the belief , was needed later the Church again understood Paul . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The God whom Paul de vied , a God who puts to shame the wisdom of the world in the narrower signification , the two great opponents of all superstition : philology and medicine , is in fact only the resolute determination of Paul himself to do so : to call God one s own will , thora , is truly jewish . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Paul wants to put to shame the wisdom of world his enemies are the good philologists and musicians of Alexandrian education , it is against them at he wages war . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In fact , nobody can be a philo lost and physician without at the same time being an Antichrist . <end>

<unchecked> <start> This priest book par excellence begins appropriately with the great inner difficulty of the priest : he has only one great danger , consequently God has only one great danger . <end>

<unchecked> <start> Against tedium even Gods struggle in vain . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What does he do ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> He contrives man , man is entertaining . <end>

<unchecked> <start> Thou shalt not know : the rest follows therefrom . <end>
<unchecked> <start> By his mortal terror God was not prevented from being shrewd . <end>
<unchecked> <start> How does one defend one s self against science ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> That was for a long time his main problem . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Answer : away with man , out of paradise ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Happiness and leisure lead to thoughts , all thoughts are bad thoughts . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Man shall not think and the priest in himself contrives distress , death , the danger of life in pregnancy , every kind of misery , old age , weariness , and above all sickness , nothing but ex pediments in the struggle against science ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Distress does not permit man to think . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And nevertheless ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> fright ful ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> the edifice of knowledge towers aloft , , dawning on the Gods , what to do ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> The old God contrives war , he separates the peoples , he brings it about that men mutually annihilate one another the priests have always had need of war . <end>
<unchecked> <start> War , among other things , a great disturbed of science ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Incredible ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Knowledge , the emancipation from the priest , augments even in spite of wars . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And a final resolution is arrived at by the old God : man has become scientific , there is no help for it , he must be drowned . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I have been understood . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The beginning of the Bible contains the entire psychology of the priest . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The priest knows only one great danger : that is science , the sound concept of cause and effect . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But science flourishes on the whole only under favour able circumstances , one must have superfluous time , one must have superfluous intellect in order to per clive . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Consequently man must be made nate , this has at all times been the logic of the priest . <end>
<unchecked> <start> One makes out what has only thereby come into the world in accordance with this logic : sin . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The concepts of guilt and punishment , the whole moral order of the world , have been devised in opposition to science , in opposition to a severance of man from the priest . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Man is not to look outwards , he is to look inwards into himself , he is not to look prudently and cautiously into things like a learner , he is not to look at all , he is to suffer . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And he is so to suffer as to need the priest always . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Away with physicians ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> A Saviour is needed . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The concepts of guilt and punishment , inclusive of the doctrines of grace , of salvation , and of forgiveness lies through and through , and without any psychological reality have been contrived to destroy the causal sense in man , they are an attack on the concepts of cause and effect ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> And not an attack with the fists , with the knife , with honesty in hate and love ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> But springing from the most cowardly , most deceitful , and most ignoble instincts ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> A priest s attack ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> A parasite s attack ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> A vampires of pale , subterranean blood suckers ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> When the natural consequences of a deed are no longer natural , but are supposed to be brought about by the conceptual spectres of superstition , by God , by spirits , by souls , as mere moral cone sequences , as reward , punishment , suggestion , or means of education , the pre requisite of perception has been destroyed the greatest crime against mankind has been committed . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Sin , repeated once more , this form of human self violation par excellence , has been invented for the purpose of making impossible science , culture , every kind of elevation and nobility of man the priest rules by the invention of sin . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I do not , in this place , excuse myself from giving a psychology of belief , of believers , for the use as is appropriate of believers . <end>
<unchecked> <start> If to day persons are still to be found who do not know in how far it is indecent to be a believer or in how far it is a symbol of decadence , of a broken will to life , they will know it by to morrow . <end>
<unchecked> <start> My voice reaches even those who are hard of hearing . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It appears , unless I have heard wrongly , that there is among Christians a kind of criterion of truth which is called the proof by power . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Belief makes blessed , therefore it is true . <end>
<unchecked> <start> One might here object in the first place that the beautifying has not been proved , only promised : blessedness has been united with the condition of believing , one is to become blessed because one believes . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But how could that be proved , that what the priest promises to the believer for the other world inaccessible to all control , will actually happen ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> The alleged proof by power is thus again , after all , only a belief that the effect , which is supposed to follow from belief , will not fail to take place . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In a formula : I believe that belief makes blessed consequently , it is true . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But here we are already at an end . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The consequently would be the absurdum itself as a criterion of truth . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Granted however , with some ob seriousness , that the beautifying by belief be proved not wished only , not promised only by the somewhat suspicious tongue of a priest , would blessedness more technically expressed , delight ever be a proof of truth ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> So little indeed that it almost furnishes the in any case the strongest suspicion against truth when feelings of delight have a voice in the question , What is true ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> The proof by delight is a proof for delight , that is all . <end>
<unchecked> <start> How is it est. <end>
<unchecked> <start> blushed for all the world that true judgments give more enjoyment than false ones , and have , necessarily , according to a pre established harmony , pleasant feel ings in their train ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> The experience of all stern , profoundly constituted intellects teaches the reverse . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Every step towards truth has had to be fought for and there has had to be abandoned for it almost whatever otherwise human hearts , human love , human confidence in life , are attached to . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Therefore greatness of soul is required : the service of truth is the hardest service . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What does it mean , then , to be upright in intellectual matters ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> To be stern with regard to one s heart , to despise fine feelings , to make one s self a con science out of every yea and nay ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Belief makes blessed : consequently it lies . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That belief under certain circumstances makes blessed , that bliss does not make a fixed idea true , that belief removes no mountains but places mountains where there are none : a hasty walk through a madhouse enlightens sufficiently on these matters . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Not a priest to be sure : for he denies by instinct that sickness is sickness and a mad house a mad house . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Christianity needs sickness , almost as Hellenism needs a surplus of , making sick is the true final purpose of the entire system of salvation price dunes of the church . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And the church itself is it not the Catholic mad house as the ultimate ideal ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> earths nothing but a mad house ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Religious man , as the church wills him to be , is a typical decadent the period when a religious crisis becomes master of a people is always distinguished by nervous epidemics the inner world of religious man is too similar to the inner world of the over excited and exhausted for any distinction between the two the highest states which Christianity has hung up over mankind as values of all values , are epileptic manifestations . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In major em dci honor em the church has canonised nobody but crazed people or great deceivers . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I once allowed myself to designate the whole Christian penitence and salvation training which can be studied best in England at present , as a folie circular methodically produced , of course upon a soil already prepared for it , e . <end>
<unchecked> <start> a thoroughly morbid soil . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Nobody is free to become a Christian : one is not converted to Christianity , one must be morbid enough for it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We others , who have the courage for and also for contempt , how we are permitted to despise a religion that teaches to mis understand the body ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> that does not want to get rid of the superstition of the soul ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> that makes a merit of insufficient nourishment ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> that combats in a sort of enemy , devil , or temptation ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> that per shaded itself that a perfect soul could be carried about in a corpse of a body , and for that purpose needed to formulate a new concept of perfection , a pale , sickly , idiotic visionary essence , so called holiness , holiness , itself merely a series of symptoms of a body impoverished , generated , and incurably ruined ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> The Christian movement as a European movement , from the beginning , is a collective move ment of all kinds of outcast and refuse elements christianity that movement strives for power . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It does noi express the decay of a race , it is an aggregate formation of forms of decadence from everywhere which crowd together and seek one another . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It was not , as is usually believed , the corruption of antiquity itself , of noble antiquity , that made Christianity possible : learned idiocy which even at present maintains such a belief cannon be contradicted with sufficient severity . <end>
<unchecked> <start> At the time when the morbid , ruined chantal classes of the whole imperium were christianized , the count e-type , nobility , existed in precisely its finest and most mature form . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The great number became master the democratise of Christian instinct conquered . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Christianity was not national , it was not racially conditioned , it appealed to every kind of persons disinherited of life , it had its allies everywhere . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Christianity has at its basis the rance of the sick , the instinct opposed to the healthy , opposed to . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Everything well constituted , proud , high spirited , and , above all , beauty , pains it in ear and eye . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Once more I remind the reader of the invaluable expression of Paul : the weak things of the world , the foolish things of the world , the base things of the world , and the things that are despised , did God choose : that was the formula , de cade nee conquered in hoc sign . <end>
<unchecked> <start> God on the cross is the frightful concept behind this symbol not as yet understood ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> All that suffers , all that hangs on the cross is divine . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We all hang on the cross , consequently we are divine . <end>
<unchecked> <start> We alone are divine . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Christianity was a victory , a nobler type of character was destroyed by it , Christianity has been the greatest misfortune hitherto of mankind . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Christianity also stands in antithesis to all intel actual well , it can only use morbid reason as Christian reason , it takes the part of all the idiotic , it pronounces a curse against intellect , against the suburbia of sound intellect . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Because sick ness belongs to the essence of Christianity , the typical Christian state , belief , must also be a form of sick ness all straight , upright , scientific paths to perception must be repudiated by the church as forbidden paths . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Doubt is already sin . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The complete want of psychological cleanliness in the priest betraying itself in his look is a phenomenon resulting from decadence , hysterical women , and children with rickety constitutions , must be observed in respect to the fre quench with which instinctive falsity , delight in lying for the sake of lying , incapacity for looking straight and walking straight , are expressions of decadence , Belief means not within tOjtoow what is true . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The pianist , the priest of both sexes , is false because he is sick his instinct is averse to truth having its rights on any point . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What makes sickly is good what comes from fullness , from abundance , from power , is evil : it is thus that the believer feels . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Constraint to lying I thereby discover every predetermined theologian . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Another mark of the theologian is his incapacity for philology . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Under philology is here meant to be understood the art of reading well in a very general sense , to be able to read off facts without falsifying them by interpretation , without losing precaution , patience , and acuteness in the desire to understand . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Philology as ephesus in inter predation : whether books , newspapers , reports , events , or facts about the weather , be the matter , not to speak of salvation of the soul . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The way in which a theologian it is all the same whether at Berlin or at Rome explains an expression of Scripture or an experience , a victory of his country s troops , for example , under the higher illumination of the Psalms of David , is always so daring that it makes the philologist run up any wall . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And what in the world is he to do when pianists and other cows from Swabia with the finger of God trans form into a miracle of grace , of providence , or of experience of salvation , the wretched common place and chamber smoke of their lives ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> The most modest expenditure of intellect , not to say of propriety , should certainly suffice to bring these interpreters to the conviction of the absolute childishness and unworthiness of such a misuse of divine manipulation . <end>
<unchecked> <start> With ever so small an amount of piety in ourselves , a God who cures us of catarrh at the right time , or who bids us get into the carriage at the exact moment when a great rain commences , ought to be such an absurd God to us , that he would have to be done away with , even if he existed . <end>
<unchecked> <start> God as a domestic servant , as a postman , as an almanac maker , after all , a word , for the stupidest kind of accidents . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Divine pro evidence , as it is still believed in by almost every third man in educated Germany would be such an ob section to God that a stronger could not be thought of . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And in any case , God is an objection to Ger mans ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is so little true that martyrs prove anything as to the truth of an affair , that I would fain deny that ever a martyr has had anything to do with truth . <end>
<unchecked> <start> By the tone in which a martyr throws at people s heads what he takes to be true , such a low grade of intellectual uprightness , such an obtuseness for the question of truth is expressed that a martyr never needs to be refuted . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Truth is no thing which one person might have and another might lack : thus , at the best , peasants , or peasant apostles like Luther , can think concerning truth . <end>
<unchecked> <start> One may be sure that proportionally to the grade of conscientiousness in intellectual matters , modesty , resignation on this point always becomes greater . <end>
<unchecked> <start> To know concerning five matters , and with dainty hand to decline to know any thing else . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Truth , as the word is understood by every prophet , every secretary , every freethinkers , every socialist , every churchman , is a complete proof that as yet there has not even a beginning been made with the intellectual discipline and self overcoming which are needed for the finding of any small , ever so small truth . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The martyr deaths , to say a word in passing , have been a great misfortune in history : they have seduced . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The inference of all idiots , women and mob included , to the effect that an affair for which any one lays down his life or which , like primitive Christianity , even produces death seeking epidemics is of importance , this inference has be come an unspeakable drag upon verification , upon the spirit of verification and precaution . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The martyrs have injured truth . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Even at present a crude form of persecution is all that is needed to create an honour able name for a sectarianism ever so indifferent in itself . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> does it alter anything in the value of an affair that somebody lays down his life for it ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> An error which becomes honourable is an error which possesses an additional seductive charm : do you think we would give you an opportunity , Messieurs the theologians , of being the martyrs for your lie ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> One refutes a thing by laying it respectfully on ice , it is just so that one refutes theologians also . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It was just the grand historical stupidity of all persecutors that they gave an honourable aspect to the cause of their opponents , that they made a present to it of the fascination of martyrdom . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Woman is still prostrate on her knees before an error , be cause she has been told that somebody has died forbus with regard to all these matters one alone has said the word that has been needed for millenniums : zarathustra . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Signs of blood have been written by them on the way they went , and it was taught by their folly that truth is proved by blood . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But blood is the worst of all witnesses for truth blood poisoned even the purest teaching and turned it into delusion and hatred of hearts . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And when a man goethe through fire for his teaching what is proved thereby ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Verily , it is more when one s own teaching springett from one s own burning . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let nobody be led astray : great intellects are sceptical . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Zarathustra is a sceptic . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Strength , freedom derived from the force and over force of intellect is proved by scepticism . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Men of conviction do not even count in determining what is fundamental in value and not value . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Convictions are prisons . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Such men do not see far enough , they do not see below them selves : but to be permitted to have a voice con corning value and not value , one must see five hundred convictions below one s self , behind one s self . <end>
<unchecked> <start> An intellect which wills what is great , which wills also the means to it , is necessarily sceptical . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The free dom from every kind of conviction , the ability to look freely , belong to strength . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Grand passion , the basis and power of a sceptic s existence , still more enlightened , still more despotic than himself , takes his entire in reflect into service it makes him unscrupulous , it gives him courage even for unholy means under certain circumstances it does not grudge to him convictions . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Conviction as a means : Many things are attained only by means of conviction . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Grand passion uses , uses up convictions , it does not subject itself to them it knows itself sovereign . <end>
<unchecked> <start> reverse , the need of a belief , of something that is unconditioned by yea or nay , carlism , if I shall be pardoned the word , is a requirement of weakness . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The man of belief , the be liver of every kind , is necessarily a dependent man , one who cannon posit himself as an end , who cannon out of himself posit ends at all . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The believer does not belong to himself , he can only be a means , he must be used up , he needs somebody who will use him up . <end>
<unchecked> <start> His instinct gives the highest honour to a morality of self abnegation : everything persuades him to it , his shrewdness , his experience , his vanity . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Every kind of belief is itself an expression of self abnegation , of . <end>
<unchecked> <start> If it be considered how necessary for most people is a regulative which binds them from the outside and makes them fast as coercion , slavery in a higher sense , is the sole and ultimate condition under which the weak willed human being , especially woman , nourishes , conviction , belief , are under stood . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The man of conviction has it for his back bone . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Not to see many things , to be nowhere un biased , to be an interested party through and through , to have strict and necessary optics with regard to all values these alone are the conditions for such a kind of man existing . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But he is thereby the antithesis , the antagonist of the truthful , of truth . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The believer is not at liberty to have at all a conscience for the questions of true and untrue to be upright here would be his immediate ruin . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Pathological of his optics makes a fanatic out of a convinced person Savonarola , Luther , Rousseau , Robespierre , Saint Simon , the type antithetical to the strong , emancipated intellect . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But the strong attitude of these morbid intellects , these conceptual epileptics , operates on the great mass the fanatics are picturesque , man kind prefers seeing postures to hearing reasons . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A step further in the psychology of conviction , of belief . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is now a long time since the question was submitted by me for consideration , whether con fictions are not more dangerous enemies of truth than falsehoods Human , All too Human I . <end>
<unchecked> <start> ah . <end>
<unchecked> <start> This time I should like to ask the decisive question : does there exist at all an antithesis between falsehood and conviction ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> All the w world believes it but what is not believed by all the world ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Every conviction has its history , its previous forms , its tentative and mistakes it becomes conviction after for a long time not having been so , after for a yet longer time having hardly been so . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> could not falsehood also be among these embryonic forms of conviction ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> It some times needs merely a change of persons : that in the son becomes conviction which in the father was still false hood . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Not wishing to see something which one sees , not wishing so to see something as one sees it : that is what I call falsehood : it does not matter whether or not the falsehood takes place in presence of witnesses . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The commonest falsehood is that by which one de chives one s self the deception of others is a relatively exceptional case . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Now this lt ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> wishing to see what one sees , this not wishing to see as one sees , is almost the first condition for all who are party in any sense whatsoever the party man becomes a liar by necessity . <end>
<unchecked> <start> German historiography , for example , is convinced that Rome was despotism , that the germanic brought the spirit of freedom into the world : what is the difference between this conviction and a falsehood ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Need one yet wonder if , by instinct , all parties in elusive of German historians have the sublime words of morality in their mouths , that morality almost continues to exist owing to party men of all kinds having need of it every hour ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> This is o ir conviction : w r e confess it before all the world , we live and die for it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Respect all that have convictions ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> I have heard the like even out of the mouths of Anti somites . <end>
<unchecked> <start> On the contrary , gentlemen ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> An Anti smite does by no means become more decent because he lies on principle . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The priests , who in such matters are more refined and understand very well the ob section which lies in the concept of a conviction , i . <end>
<unchecked> <start> e . <end>
<unchecked> <start> a mendacity that is axiomatic because it serves the purpose have obtained from the Jews the policy of inserting in this place the concepts God , will of God , revelation of God . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Kant also , with his categorical imperative , was on the same road : his reason became practical in this matter . <end>
<unchecked> <start> There are questions in which the decision concerning truth or untruth does not appertain to man all highest questions , all highest problems of value are beyond human rea son . <end>
<unchecked> <start> To understand the limits of reason , that only is genuine philosophy . <end>
<unchecked> <start> For what end did God give man revelation ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Would God have done anything superfluous ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Man cannon know of himself what is good and evil on that account God taught him his will . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Moral : the priest does not lie , the question of true or untrue , in such matters as priests speak about , does not even permit of lying . <end>
<unchecked> <start> For in order to be able to lie one would require to he able to determine what is true here . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But that is just that man cannon do the priest is thereby only the mouthpiece of God . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Such a priestly syllogism is by no means exclusively Jewish or Christian the right of lying and the policy of revelation belong to the type of the priest , to the priests of decadence as well as of heathenism heathens are all who say yea to life , to whom God is the word for the great yea to everything . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Law , will of God , the holy book , inspiration , all only words for the conditions under which the priest attains to power , by which he maintains his power these concepts are found at the basis of every organisation of priests , of every hierarchic or philosophy hierarchic structure . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Holy falsehood common to Confucius , to the Law book of Manu , to Mohammed , to the Christian church , it is not absent in Plato . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Truth is here : that means wherever it becomes audible , the priest lies . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Finally it is of moment , for what end there is lying . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That in Christianity holy ends are lacking is via objection to its means . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Only bad ends , poison ing , , and denying of life , despising of body , abasement and self violation of man through the concept of sin consequently its means also are bad . <end>
<unchecked> <start> With an entirely different feeling , I read the logbook oman , an incomparably intellectual and superior work , which it would be a sin against the spirit even to name in the same breath with the Bible . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It appears at once : it has an actual philosophy behind it , in it , not a mere bad smelling Jewish acid of rabbinic and superstition , it gives even to the most dainty psychologist something to bite at . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Not to forget the main thing , the fundamental difference from every kind of Bible : the noble classes , the philosophers and the warriors by means of it stretch out their hands over the multitude noble values everywhere , a feel ing of perfection , an affirmation of life , a triumphing agreeable sensation in one s self and in life , sunshine spreads over the entire book . <end>
<unchecked> <start> All the things which Christianity takes for objects of its unfathomable vol parity , for example procreation , woman , marriage , are here treated seriously , with reverence , love , and con evidence . <end>
<unchecked> <start> How can one really put a book into the hands of children and women which contains those vile words : Because of fornication let each man have his own wife , and let each woman have her own husband . <end>
<unchecked> <start> for it is better to marry than to burn ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> And is it allowable to be a Christian as long as the origin of man is christianized , i . <end>
<unchecked> <start> e . <end>
<unchecked> <start> fouled with the concept of immaculate conception ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> I know of no book in which so many delicate and kind things are said of woman as in the Law book of Manu those old gray beards and saints have a mode of being gracious towards women , which perhaps has not been surpassed . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The mouth of a woman , the book says once , the bosom of a maiden , the prayer of a child , the smoke of sacrifice , are ever pure . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Another passage : There is nothing purer than the light of the sun , the shadow of a cow , air , water , fire , and the breath of a maiden . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A last passage perhaps also a holy lie : All openings of the body above the navel are pure , all under it are impure . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In a maiden only the whole body is pure . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The holiness of Christian means is surprised in flagrant , when for once the Christian end is measured by the end of the Law book of Manu , when this greatest antithesis of ends is put under a strong light . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The critic of Christianity cannon help making Christianity contemptible . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Such a law book as that of minute ANTICHRIST originates like every good law book : it sums up the experience , the policy and the experimental morality of long centuries it finishes , it no longer creates . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The pre requisite for a codification of that kind is the insight that the means for creating authority for a truth slowly and expensively acquired , are fundament ally different from those with which one would prove it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A law book never recounts the advantage , the reasons , the casuistry in the previous history of a law : it would just thereby lose its imperative tone , the thou shalt , the pre requisite for its being obeyed . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The problem lies exactly in this . <end>
<unchecked> <start> At a certain point in the development of a nation , its most circumspect class i . <end>
<unchecked> <start> e . <end>
<unchecked> <start> the most retrospective and prospective declares the experience to be closed according to which people are to live i . <end>
<unchecked> <start> e . <end>
<unchecked> <start> according to which they can live . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Its aim is to bring home from the times of experiment and importunate experience the richest and completes harvest possible . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Consequently , what is above all to be avoided , is the continuation of experimenting , the continuation of the fluid condition of values , testing , choosing , and criticising of values in infinite . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A double wall is established in opposition to this : on the one hand revelation , i . <end>
<unchecked> <start> e . <end>
<unchecked> <start> the assertion that the reason of those laws is not of human origin , not wearisome sought out and found after many mistakes , but of divine origin , entire , perfect , without a history , a bestowal , a miracle , a mere communication . <end>
<unchecked> <start> On the other hand tradition , i . <end>
<unchecked> <start> e . <end>
<unchecked> <start> the assertion that the law has already existed since primitive times , that it is impious , that it is a crime against the ancestors , to call it in question . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The authority of the law is established by the theses : God gave it , the ancestors lived under it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The higher reason of such procedure consists in the design to thrust back the consciousness step by step from the mode of life recognised as correct . <end>
<unchecked> <start> e . <end>
<unchecked> <start> proved by an experience immense and sharply sifted , so that a perfect automatism of instinct is attained , the pre requisite for every kind of master lines , for every kind of perfection in the art of life . <end>
<unchecked> <start> To draw up a law book like that of Manu means the concession to a people to become in future masterly , perfect , to exercise ambition for the highest art of life . <end>
<unchecked> <start> For that end it must be trade unconscious : that is the object of all holy falsehood . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The order of castes , the highest , the dominating law , is only the sanction of an order of nature , natural lawfulness of the first rank , over which no arbitrariness , no modern idea , has power . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In every healthy society , three types , mutually conditioning and differently gravitating , physiologically separate themselves , each of which has its own hygiene , its own domain of labour , its own special sentiment of perfection , its own special mastership . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Nature , not Manu , separates from one another the mainly intellectual individuals , the in individuals mainly excelling in muscular strength , and the third class neither distinguished in the one nor in the other , the mediocre individuals , the latter as the great number , the former as the select individuals . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The highest caste I call them the fewest has , as the perfect caste , the privileges of the fewest : it belongs thereto to represent happiness , beauty , goodness on earth . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Only the most intellectual men have the permission to beauty , to the beautiful it is only with them that goodness is not weakness . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Pulchruni cst homing : the good is a privilege . <end>
<unchecked> <start> On the other hand , nothing can be less permissible to them than unpleasant manners or a pessimistic look , an eye that makes deformed , or even indignation with regard to the entire aspect of things . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Indignation is the privilege of the chantal and pessimism similarly . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The world is perfect thus speaks the instinct of the most intellectual men , affirmative instinct imperfection , every kind of in priority to us , distance , pathos of distance , even the chantal belong to this perfection . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The most intellectual men , as the strongest , find their happiness in that in which others would find their ruin : in the labyrinth , in severity towards themselves and others , in effort their delight is self overcoming : with them asceticism becomes naturalness , requirement , instinct . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A difficult task is regarded by them as a privilege , to play with burdens which crush others to death , as a recreation . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Knowledge , a form of asceticism . <end>
<unchecked> <start> They are the most venerable kind of man . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That does not exclude their being the most cheerful , the most amiable . <end>
<unchecked> <start> They rule , not because they will , but because they are they are not at liberty to be the second in rank . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The second in rank are : the guar diana of right , the keepers of order and security , the noble warriors , the king , above all , as the highest formula of warrior , judge , and keeper of the law . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The second in rank are the executive of the most in intellectual , the most closely associated with them , relief ing them of all that is coarse in the work of ruling , their retinue , their right hand , their best disciples . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In all that , to repeat it once more , there is nothing arbitrary , nothing artificial what is otherwise is artificial , by what is otherwise , nature is put to shame . <end>
<unchecked> <start> By the order of castes , the order of rank , the supreme law of life itself is formulated only the separation of the three types is necessary for the maintenance of society , for the making possible of higher and highest types , the inequality of rights is the very condition of there being rights at all . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A right is a privilege . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In his mode of existence every one has his privilege . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let us not undervalue the privileges of the mediocre . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Life always becomes harder towards the summit , the cold increases , re responsibility increases . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A high civilisation is a pyramid : it can only stand upon a broad basis , it has for a first pre requisite a strongly and soundly consolidated mediocrity . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Handicraft , trade , agriculture , science , the greater part of art , in a word , the whole compass of business activity , is exclusively compatible with an average amount of ability and pretension the like pursuits would be displaced among the exceptions , the instinct appropriate thereto would contradict aristocratic as well as anarchism . <end>
<unchecked> <start> There is a determination of nature that a person should be a public utility , a wheel , a function : not society , the kind of happiness of which alone the larger number are capable , makes intelligent machines out of them . <end>
<unchecked> <start> For the mediocre , it is a happiness to be mediocre for them the mastery in one thing , specialism , is a natural instinct . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It would be altogether unworthy of a profounder intellect to see in mediocrity itself an objection . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is indeed the first necessity for the possibility of exceptions : a high civilisation is conditioned by it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> If the exceptional man just treats the mediocre with a more delicate touch than himself and his equals , it is not mere cour test of heart , it is simply his duty . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Whom do I hate most among the mob of the present day ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> The Socialist mob , the chantal apostles , who undermine the working man s instinct , his pleasure , his feeling of connectedness with his petty existence , who make him envious , who teach him revenge . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The wrong never lies in unequal rights , it lies in the pretension to equal rights . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What is bad ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> But I said it already : all that springs from weakness , from envy , from revenge . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The anarchist and the Christian are of the same origin . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In fact it makes a difference for what object a person lies : whether he thereby preserves or destroys . <end>
<unchecked> <start> One may institute a perfect equation between the Christian and the anarchist : their object , their instinct is towards destruction . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The proof of this propose tion can be read plainly from history , it is contained in history with frightful distinctness . <end>
<unchecked> <start> If we just became acquainted with a religious legislation whose object was to make eternal the highest condition for making life flourish , a great organisation of society , Christianity , on the other hand , found its mission in putting an end to just such an organisation , because life flourished in it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> There the proceeds of reason from long periods of experiment and uncertainty were intended to be invested for the most remote advantage and the harvest was intended to be brought home as large , as rich , and as complete as possible : here , reverse , the harvest was blighted during the night . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That which stood there care perennis , the imperium Romanum , the grandest form of organisation under difficult conditions that has hitherto been realised , in comparison w r ith which everything previous , every thing subsequent , is patchwork , bungling , and , those holy anarchists have made a piety out of destroying the world i . <end>
<unchecked> <start> e . <end>
<unchecked> <start> the imperium Romanum , until no stone remained upon another , until even germanic and other books could become master over it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The Christian and the anarchist : both decadent , both incapable of operating otherwise than disintegrating , blighting , stunting , blood-sucking , both incarnation the instinct of mortal hatred of whatever stands , whatever is great , whatever has dura ability , whatever promises futurity to life . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Christianity was the vampire of the imperium Romanum , in the night it has undone the immense achievement of the Romans , of obtaining the site for a grand civilisation that would require time . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Is it not yet understood ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> The imperium Romanum which we know , which the history of the Roman province always teaches us to know better , that most admirable work of art of the grand style , was a commencement , its structure w r as calculated to prove itself by millenniums , hitherto there has never been such building , no building in like magnitude sub specie has even been dreamt of ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> That organisation was steadfast enough to endure bad emperors : the accident of persons must have nothing to do in such matters , first principle of all great architecture . <end>
<unchecked> <start> But it was not steadfast enough against the comptes kind of corruption , against the Christian . <end>
<unchecked> <start> These stealthy vermin which , in darkness , obscurity , and duplicity , approached every individual , sucking out of him the seriousness for tribe things , the entire instinct for realities that cowardly , feminine , and honeyed crew have gradually estranged the souls from that immense edifice , those valuable , those manly , noble natures , who felt the affair of Rome to be their own affair , their own seriousness , their own pride . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Hypocrite sneaking , conventicle healthiness , gloomy concepts such as hell , sacrifice of the innocent , union mystical in blood drinking , above all the slowly stirred fire of revenge , of chantal revenge that became master over Rome , the same kind of religion against the pre existent form of which Epicurus had waged war . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let a person read Lucretius to understand what Epicurus combated , not heathenism , but Christianity , i . <end>
<unchecked> <start> e . <end>
<unchecked> <start> the depravity of souls by the concepts of guilt , punishment , and immortality . <end>
<unchecked> <start> He combated the sub terranes cults , the whole latent Christianity to deny immortality was then an actual salvation . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And Epicurus would have conquered every respectable intellect in the Roman empire was Epicurean : then Paul appeared . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Paul , the incarnated , genius inspired chantal hatred against Rome , against the world , the Jew , the eternal Jew par excellence . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What he found out was how to light a universal conflagration by the aid of the small sectarian Christian movement apart from Judaism , how to sum up to a prodigious power by the symbol of God on the cross all the inferior , all the secretly seditious , the whole headship of the anarchist intrigues in the empire . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Salvation is of the Jews . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Christianity as a formula for outbuilding and summing up all kinds of subterranean cults , like those of Osiris , of the Great M other , of Mithra , for example : Paul s genius consists in discerning this . <end>
<unchecked> <start> His instinct was so certain therein that , with regardless violence to truth , he put the ideas with which those chantal religions fascinated into the mouth of the Saviour of his own invention , and not only into the mouth that he made out of him something which a Mithra priest also could understand . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That was his moment of Damascus : he understood that he needed the belief in immortality in order to depreciate the world , that the concept of hell becomes even master of Rome , that life is killed by the other world . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Nihilist and Christian : they rhyme in German , and do not rhyme only . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The whole labour of the ancient world in vain : I have no words to express my sentiments with re gard to a thing so hideous . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And in consideration that its work was a preparation , that only the sub structure was laid with granite self consciousness for the work of millenniums , the entire meaning of the ancient world in vain ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> For what end the Greeks ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> for what end the Romans ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> All pre requisites to a learned civilisation , all scientific methods were already there , the great , the incomparable art of reading well had already been established that pre requisite to the tradition of civilisation , to the unity of science natural science in alliance with mathematics and mechanics were on the best of all paths , the sense for fact , the last and most valuable of all senses , had its schools and its tradition already centuries old ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Is that understood ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Every thing essential had been discovered to enable people to go to work : the methods , it must be repeated ten times , are the essen trial thing , also the most difficult thing , and besides the things that have habit and indolence longest against them . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What we have now won back for ourselves with unspeakable self vanishing for we have still somehow all bad instincts , Christian instincts in our nature the open look in presence of reality , the cautious hand , patience and earnestness in details , all the righteousness in knowledge , it was already there ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> already , more than two thousand years ago ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> And added thereto , the excellent , refined tact and taste ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Not as brain drilling ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Not as German culture with boorish manners ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> But as body , as bearing , as instinct , in a word , as reality . <end>
<unchecked> <start> All in vain ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Ere the morrow , merely a memory ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> The Greeks ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> The Romans ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Nobility of instinct , taste , methodical invest nation , genius for organisation and administration , belief in , mil to the future of man , the great yea to all things visible as imperium Romanum , visible to all senses , the grand style , no longer merely art , but become reality , truth , life . <end>
<unchecked> <start> And choked in the night , not by any natural accident ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Not trampled down by germanic and other heavy footed creatures ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> But put to shame by crafty , secretive , invisible , anaemic vampires ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Not conquered , only sucked out ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Hidden vindictiveness , petty envy become master ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Everything wretched , suffering from itself , visited by bad feelings , the entire Ghetto world of soul , uppermost all at once ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> One has but to read any Christian agitator , Saint Augustine for instance , to be able to smell what dirty fellows have thereby got uppermost . <end>
<unchecked> <start> One would be thoroughly deceived by presupposing any want of understanding in the leaders of the Christian move ment : oh , they are shrewd , shrewd even to holiness , Messieurs the Fathers of the Church ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> What they lack is something quite different . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Nature neglected them , it forgot to give them a modest dowry of respect able , decent , cleanly instincts . <end>
<unchecked> <start> In confidence , they are not even men . <end>
<unchecked> <start> If Islam despises Christianity it has a thousand times the right to do so : Islam has men for a pre requisite . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Christianity has made us lose the harvest of ancient civilisation , it has again , later , made us lose the harvest of Islam civilisation . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The wonderful world of Moorish civilisation of Spain , on the whole nearer akin to us , speaking more to sense and taste than Rome and Greece , was trampled down I do not say by what sort of feet , why ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> because it owed its origin to noble , to manly instincts , because it said yea to life , even with the rare and refined jewels of Moorish life ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> The crusaders , later , combated something before which it might have been more becoming for them to lie in the dust , a civilisation in comparison with which even our nineteenth century might appear to itself very poor , very late . <end>
<unchecked> <start> To be sure , they wanted to gain booty : the Orient was rich . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let us not be bias sed ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Crusades superior piracy , that is all . <end>
<unchecked> <start> German nobility , a Viking nobility at bottom , was there in its element : the church knew only too well by what German nobility is attracted . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The German noble , always the Swiss guard of the church , always in the service of all bad instincts of the church , but well paid . <end>
<unchecked> <start> That the church , just with the aid of German swords , German blood and courage , has carried through its mortally hostile warfare against everything noble upon earth ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> There are at this place a great number of painful questions . <end>
<unchecked> <start> German nobility is scarcely to be met with in the history of higher civilisation : the reason is obvious . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Christianity , alcohol the two great means of corruption . <end>
<unchecked> <start> For in itself , there should be no choice in the face of Islam and Christianity , as little as in the face of an Arab and a Jew . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The decision is given nobody is still free to choose here . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Either a person is a chantal , or he is not . <end>
<unchecked> <start> War to the knife with Rome ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Peace , friendship with Islam : it was thus that the great free spirit , the genius among the German emperors , Frederic n . <end>
<unchecked> <start> felt , it was thus that he did . <end>
<unchecked> <start> What ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> has a German to be first a genius , to be first a free spirit in order to feel be coming ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> I do not understand how a German could ever feel Christian . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Here it is necessary to touch upon a reminiscence a hundred times more painful to Germans . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The Ger mans have caused Europe the loss of the last great harvest of civilisation that was to be garnered for Europe the Renaissance . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Is it at last understood , is it desired to be understood what the Renaissance was ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> The of Christian values , the attempt , under taken with all means , with all instincts , with all genius , to bring about the triumph of the opposite values , the noble values . <end>
<unchecked> <start> There has only been this great war hitherto , there has hitherto been no more de decisive question than the Renaissance , my question is its question : neither has there ever been a form of attack more fundamental , more direct , more strenuously de levered with a whole front upon the centre of the enemy ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> To attack at the most decisive place , at the seat of Christianity itself , to set in this respect upon the throne the noble values i . <end>
<unchecked> <start> e . <end>
<unchecked> <start> to introduce them into the most radical requirements and longings of those sitting there . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I see before me the possibility of a perfectly supernatural enchantment and colour charm : it seems to me to shine in all tremors of refined beauty , that there is an art at work in it , so divine , so devilishly divine , that one might seek for millenniums in vain for a second example of such a possibility I see a spectacle so ingenious , so wonder fully paradoxical at the same time , that all Divinities of Olympus would have had an occasion for an im mortal laughter caesar Borgia as Pope . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Am I understood ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> Well , that would have been the triumph for which alone am longing at present Christianity would thereby have been done away with ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> What happened ? <end>
<unchecked> <start> A German monk , Luther , came to Rome . <end>
<unchecked> <start> This monk , with all the vindictive instincts of an abortive priest in his nature , became furious against the Renaissance in Rome . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Instead of , with the profoundest gratitude , understanding the prodigy that had taken place , the overcoming of Christianity at its seat , his hatred only knew how to draw its nourish ment from this spectacle . <end>
<unchecked> <start> A religious person thinks only of himself . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Luther saw the depravity of Popery , while the very reverse was palpable : the old depravity , the originate , Christianity , no longer sat on the throne of the Pope ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> But life ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> The triumph of life ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> The great yea to all things high , beautiful and daring ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> And Luther restored the Church once more : he attacked it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The Renaissance an event without meaning , a great in vain ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Ah those Germans , what they have already cost us ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> In vain that has ever been the work of the Germans . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The Reformation Leibniz Kant and so called German philosophy the wars of Liberation the Empire every time an in vain for something that had already existed , for some thing irrecoverable . <end>
<unchecked> <start> They are my enemies , I con less it , these Germans : In despising them I despise , every kind of cleanliness in concepts and valuations , every kind of cowardice in presence of every straight forward yea and nay . <end>
<unchecked> <start> They have felted and confused , for a thousand years almost , whatever they laid their fingers on , they have on their conscience all the harnesses the three ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> from which Europe is sick , they have also on their conscience the foulest kind of Christianity , the most incurable , the most irrefutable that exists , Protestantism . <end>
<unchecked> <start> If we do not get done with Christianity , the Germans will be to blame for it . <end>
<unchecked> <start> With this I am at the conclusion and pronounce my sentence . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I condemn Christianity , I bring against the Christian church the most terrible of all accusations that ever an accuser has taken into his mouth . <end>
<unchecked> <start> It is to me the greatest of all imaginable corruptions , it has had the will to the ultimate corruption that is at all possible . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The Christian church has left nothing untouched with its depravity , it has made a worthlessness out of every value , a lie out of every truth , a baseness of soul out of every straightforwardness . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Let a person still dare to speak to me of its humanitarian blessings ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> To do away with any state of distress whatsoever was counter to its profoundest expediency , it lived by states of distress , it created states of distress in order to perpetuate itself eternally . <end>
<unchecked> <start> The worm of sin for example it is only the church that has enriched mankind with this state of distress ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> The equality of souls before God , this falsehood , this pretence for the ranches of all the base minded , this explosive material of a concept which has finally be come revolution , modern idea , and decadence principle of the whole order of society is Christian dynamite . <end>
<unchecked> <start> Humanitarian blessings of Christianity ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> To breed out of a self contradiction , an art of , a will to the lie at any price , a repugnance , a contempt for all good and straightforward instincts ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Those are for me blessings of Christianity ! <end>
<unchecked> <start> Para sites as the sole praxis of the church drinking out all blood , all love , all hope for life , with its anaemic ideal of holiness the other world as the will to the negation of every reality the cross as the rallying sign for the most subterranean conspiracy that has ever existed , against healthiness , beauty , well constituted ess , courage , intellect , benevolence of soul , against life itself . <end>
<unchecked> <start> This eternal accusation of Christianity I shall write on all walls , wherever there are walls , I have letters for making even the blind see . <end>
<unchecked> <start> I call Christianity the one great curse , the one great intrinsic depravity , the one great instinct of revenge for which no ex pediment is sufficiently poisonous , secret , subterranean , mean , I call it the one immortal blemish of man kind . <end>
