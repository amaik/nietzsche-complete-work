# Complete Work of Friedrich Nietzsche

This is a dataset I created for some experimentation with language modelling.  
The source of the dataset are scanned books from the [internet archive](https://archive.org/).
Since the source is a scan from old books the dataset is very noisy and there where challenges with cleaning it.
I ended up writing a script to resolve the last typos and spelling mistakes by hand but deemed it too much work. 

However, this might be helpful as an insight what can be done in cleaning a text dataset.
